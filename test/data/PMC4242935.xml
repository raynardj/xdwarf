exercise (CSE) on the physical and psychological functions of elderly women while
negotiating general obstacles. [Subjects and Methods] After allocating 10 elderly women
each to the core stability training group and the control group, we carried out
Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) and measured crossing velocity (CV),
maximum vertical heel clearance (MVHC), and knee flexion angle for assessing physical
performances. We evaluated depression and fear of falling for assessing psychological
functions. [Results] Relative to the control group, the core stability training group
showed statistically significant overall changes after the training session: an increase
in POMA scores, faster CV, lower MVHC, and a decrease in knee flexion angle. Furthermore,
depression and fear of falling decreased significantly. [Conclusion] CSE can have a
positive effect on the improvement of physical and psychological performances of older
women who are vulnerable to falls as they negotiate everyday obstacles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Core stabilization exercises</kwd><kwd>Elderly women</kwd><kwd>Falls</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Falls are one of the leading injury-related accidents involving older adults whose muscular
strength, proprioceptive sense, and bodily coordination are compromised with aging<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elderly lack obstacle negotiation
capacity and are prone to trip over commonly encountered environmental barriers such as door
sills, pavement blocks, and safety bumps<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In a local community, 33% of elderly people were reported to experience falls, of which
42.4% suffered falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Individuals with a history of falls have fears of repeated falls, depression, and anxiety,
all of which lead to decreased physical activities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These negative experiences result in reduced physical capacity in
terms of muscular strength, bodily flexibility, and coordination, rendering the affected
elderly even more susceptible to falls in a vicious cycle<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Notably, elderly women are more at risk of secondary injury such as
severe fractures after falling than elderly men because of their low bone density after
menopause<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Interventions for fall prevention include exercise, education, environmental improvements,
and medication<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, of which exercise has been
used in fall prevention programs in many ways, as it takes less time and money to implement
and programs are easy to set up.</p><p>Carter et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported in a
bibliographical study on exercise intervention that exercise improved leg strength 44.4% and
balance ability 37.5% in older adults and that as weakness of muscle strength in the trunk
was more important than that in the lower extremities, strengthening of lumbar function can
improve functional stability, leading to increased balance ability, gait ability, and
prevention of falling<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Core stabilization exercise (CSE) can improve balance control ability by reinforcing
intersegmental muscles in the multifidus, transversus abdominis, and rotators<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and physicopsychological functions in a
harmonious way by stimulating proprioception powerfully when it is accompanied by Swiss ball
exercises, improving balance sense, and maintenance ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies on falling in elderly adults involving CSE have
been limited to balance ability or gait ability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and there have been only a few
studies on obstacles as an environmental factor or psychological factors.</p><p>Therefore, this study evaluated changes in the physicopsychological functions of elderly
women with a fear of falling in negotiating obstacles such as a doorstep (5.2&#x02005;cm) of a
bathroom, where falling occurs frequently, through a Performance-Oriented Mobility
Assessment (POMA) in order to understand whether CSE is valid as an efficient exercise to
prevent and control falling in consideration of the physicopsychological functions of
elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the study were 20 elderly women above the age of 65 who were able to walk
independently, did not have experience participating in regular balance training more than
twice a week within the past 6 months, had a score higher than 24 on the Mini-Mental Status
Examination-Korea (MMSE-K), had no limits on exercise performance due to visual or
musculoskeletal disorders and no previous experience of falling, and scored lower than 19 on
the Tinetti POMA<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose and
methods of this study were explained to all the participants, who read and signed an
informed consent from that revealed all the details of the study protocol, which were
approved by the ethics committee of Kangwon National University (No. 2013-11-001-002).</p><p>The subjects selected were divided into an experimental group and a control group by
drawing lots, and the average age, height, and weight in the experimental group were
73.20&#x000b1;3.46&#x02005;years, 152.15&#x000b1;4.29&#x02005;cm, and 57.78&#x000b1;7.95&#x02005;kg, while those in the control group were
71.00&#x000b1;3.50&#x02005;years, 149.83&#x000b1;6.45&#x02005;cm, and 53.80&#x000b1;11.04&#x02005;kg. There were no significant differences
among the groups with regard to age, height, or weight (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The core stabilization exercise program proposed by Jeffrey<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and Hesari et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> was applied to the experimental group and CSE was composed of three
steps. Level 1 consisted of abdominal hollowing in a supine position, abdominal hollowing in
a prone position, abdominal hollowing in a quadruped position, abdominal hollowing in a
supine position while curling the feet, abdominal hollowing in a prone position while
curling the feet, and modified side bridging. Level 2 consisted of bridging with abdominal
hollowing, pelvic bridging, the dying bug with abdominal hollowing, and abdominal hollowing
while seated on a Swiss Ball. Level 3 consisted of pelvic bridging with a Swiss ball, bird
dog exercise, twists on a Swiss ball, and bird dog exercises on a Swiss ball. The
experimental group performed a core stabilization program consisting of three levels for
30&#x02005;min, three times per week on alternate days, for 6 weeks. This program consisted of three
levels, and the subjects began at exercise level 1 and proceeded to the next level according
to the protocol for the day. Level 1 included static holds in a stable environment, Level 2
included dynamic movements in a stable environment, and Level 3 included dynamic movements
in an unstable environment, such as on a Swiss ball, and resisted dynamic movements in an
unstable environment.</p><p>Before the program and 6 weeks after the program, the Tinetti POMA, crossing velocity (CV),
maximum vertical heel clearance (MVHC) and knee flexion angle, which are related to physical
functions, were measured, and with respect to psychological functions, depression and fear
of falling were measured. The Tinetti POMA is an instrument used to decide the degree of
fear of falling and balance and mobility in elderly adults consisting of items scored on a
3-point scale. The maximum score is 28, with 16 points for balance and 12 points for gait.
If a subject scores below 19, fear of falling is high, and scores of 19 to 24 indicate an
intermediate degree for fear of falling; scores of 25 to 28 indicate no fear of falling. For
the crossing velocity (CV), the horizontal distance from the point at which the leading limb
leaves the ground to the point at which the heel returns to the ground again is divided by
the time taken<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the maximum
vertical heel clearance (MVHC), the vertical distance from the height of the obstacle before
obstacle negotiation to the ball of the leading limb was measured<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the knee flexion angle, the angles were measured at
the MVHC<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The obstacle was 60&#x02005;cm long,
10&#x02005;cm wide, and 5.2&#x02005;cm high. The subjects began their gait 5&#x02005;m from the obstacle and
continued on 3&#x02005;m after obstacle negotiation. Obstacle gait variables were filmed with a
camcorder and saved on a computer. CV and MVHC were measured with the use of Dartfish
software (Dartfish, Fribourg, Switzerland)<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the results were output in a data table. To analyze
depression, the CES-D (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale) was used. It is
scored on a 4-point scale (0&#x02013;3), and includes a total of 20 questions. The higher the score,
the higher the depression<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. For fear of
falling, the FOFQ (Fear of Falling Questionnaire) was used. It is scored on a 4-point scale
(1&#x02013;4) and includes a total of 11 questions. The higher the score, the higher the fear of
falling<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For statistical analysis of the results, SPSS 18.0 was used. The Shapiro-Wilk test was
performed as a test of normality. To explain the differences in measurement variables
according to the measurement period between exercise groups, a 2-way ANOVA with repeated
measure was used, and the level of statistical significance was &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Repeated measure ANOVA to analyze changes in the POMA, CV, MVHC, KF, depression, and FOF

that occur with ageing<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to
compensate for balance and stability in gait, cadence and stride length decrease<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of obstacle negotiation, when
the leading foot encounters obstacles, the center of the body moves forward and fear of
falling increases<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this case, the
MVHC, joint angle, and CV are important measures to assess the ability of elderly adults to
safely cross obstacles during gait<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although falling is not always accompanied by physical injury, fear
of falling again can be used to predict falling in elderly adults<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fear of falling leads to a decrease in activity and low
self-esteem for independent behavior<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and
has direct negative effects that result in decreased balance and gait disorder<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CSE is training to improve the stability of the trunk by inducing a correcting reaction and
an equilibrium reaction through balance training of the flexors and extensors, and as it has
been judged to have an effect on physicopsychological functions in obstacle negotiation, a
clinical study was conducted.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that the Tinetti POMA, CV, MVHC, and knee flexion
angle were significantly improved. Esculier et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> provided lumbar stability training through a Wii Fit program for
Parkinson&#x02019;s patients for 6 weeks and administered the Tinetti POMA. They reported that the
scores significantly increased from 24 points to 28. Chou et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the CV was slow for elderly adults with
lower balance ability. Weerdesteyn et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> provided balance, gait, and coordination training for elderly
adults and reported that foot clearance decreased, which matched with the results of the
present study. Park and Lee<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that the maximum knee flexion angle of normal adults with lumbar stability was significantly
lower in comparison with that of elderly adults with lumbar instability, which partially
matched with the results of the present study. The study by Lee et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that a falling prevention program decreased
the GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) significantly, was in agreement with the study by Duque
et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that fear of
falling by elderly adults who experienced falling significantly decreased as a result of
balance training using a virtual reality system.</p><p>Such results indicate that stability of the trunk was secured, as CSE decreased the sway
area of the center of mass. Through harmonious exercise of the limbs based on physical
stability, the subjects could negotiate obstacles precisely and easily, had higher
self-esteem and had less fear of falling and depression. It is suggested that the 6-week CSE
decreased excessive obstacle gait with physical instability in elderly women and improved
their physicopsychological functions involving obstacle gait.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Bendall</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Falls by elderly people at home: prevalence and associated
