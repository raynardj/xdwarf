However, it is unclear how this single mutation produces a probe with such a large modulation of its fluorescence output with changes in membrane potential. In this study, we identified which residues in super ecliptic pHluorin (vs eGFP) are critical for the ArcLight response, as a similarly constructed probe based on eGFP also exhibits large response amplitude if it carries these critical residues. We found that D147 is responsible for determining the pH sensitivity of the fluorescent protein used in these probes but by itself does not result in a voltage probe with a large signal. We also provide evidence that the voltage dependent signal of ArcLight is not simply sensing environmental pH changes. A two-photon polarization microscopy study showed that ArcLight's response to changes in membrane potential includes a reorientation of the super ecliptic pHluorin. We also explored different changes including modification of linker length, deletion of non-essential amino acids in the super ecliptic pHluorin, adding a farnesylation site, using tandem fluorescent proteins and other pH sensitive fluorescent proteins.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (U24NS057631, DC005259-43, ARRA U24NS057631-03S1, ARRA-R01NS065110 and R01NS083875), the World Class Institute program of the National Research Foundation of Korea, Grant Number: WCI 2009-003, and the Czech Republic Science Foundation grant P205/13-10799S.

Here we demonstrated that a similarly constructed probe based on eGFP also exhibits large response amplitude if all four critical residues are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We found that residue D147 alone is responsible for the base-shifted (relative to eGFP) pH sensitivity of super ecliptic pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g002">Figure 2</xref>), but D147 by itself is not enough to result in a large &#x00394;F/&#x00394;V signal when introduced to an eGFP based probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These four critical residues are all located in close vicinity and are on one side of the &#x003b2;-barrel surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This side of the surface is also the dimerization contact surface in avGFP <xref rid="pone.0113873-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Further investigation is needed to determine how these mutations coordinate. Intriguingly, the ArcLight probe carrying tandem fluorescent proteins had a greatly reduced response amplitude and a change in response direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g009">Figure 9</xref>). It is possible that the tandem super ecliptic pHluorins in this ArcLight variant form an intramolecular dimer and that this dimerization may inhibit the fluorescence changes of the probe by interfering with intermolecular dimerization or association with the plasma membrane.</p><p>Similarly constructed probes carrying pH sensitive fluorescent proteins other than super ecliptic pHluorin A227D, i.e. the YFP and ratiometric pHluorin, did not have large voltage dependent changes in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These new probes produced only small response amplitude. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of the A227D mutation only served to further decrease their signal sizes. These results (together with above described result of an eGFP based probe carrying the S147D mutation) show that pH sensitivity of the fluorescent protein alone is not sufficient to produce a large signal. Furthermore, the <italic>Ciona</italic> protein carrying super ecliptic pHluorin does not exhibit a large response amplitude without introducing the A227D mutation <xref rid="pone.0113873-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We also demonstrated that shifting the voltage sensitivity of the Ciona voltage sensor by introducing mutations to the S4 domain also shifts the fluorescence response of ArcLight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The correlation between the voltage sensitivity and the fluorescence changes provides a third line of evidence that ArcLight does not simply sense a pH changes that results from the membrane potential change.</p><p>We used two-photon polarization microscopy, an anisotropy method, to examine changes in the FPs orientation with changes in voltage and altered amino acids at the linker domain. Two-photon polarization microscopy allows sensitive observations of changes in orientation of fluorescent moieties with respect to the cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0113873-Lazar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In two-photon polarization microscopy, molecular orientation can be characterized by the maximum dichroic ratio <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic>: the ratio of fluorescence intensities (Fh/Fv) observed using two perpendicular polarizations (horizontal and vertical in the frame of the image) of the excitation beam. For a horizontally oriented section of the cell membrane, the <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic> is largest (theoretically infinite) when the two-photon excitation pseudo-transition dipole moment of the fluorescent moiety is oriented parallel to the plasma membrane, and smallest (theoretically zero) when the pseudo- transition dipole moment is perpendicular to the membrane. We found that the fluorescent protein in all three tested probes undergoes voltage-induced reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In response to cell membrane depolarization, CiVSD-EP and ArcLight-S249 showed similar, small <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic> increases. This indicates that these two FPs' pseudo- transition dipole moments rotated slightly towards the plasma membrane. Interestingly, although the two constructs show similar changes in <italic>r</italic>, ArcLight-S249 exhibits a much larger fluorescence decrease than CiVSD-EP. In contrast to ArcLight-S249 and CiVSD-EP, Arclight-Q239 showed a decrease in <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic>, indicating that its pseudo- transition dipole moment rotated away from the plasma membrane, and the <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic> change was larger than in CiVSD-EP and ArcLight-S249. Thus, although the three constructs share a decrease in fluorescence intensity upon depolarization, the underlying molecular rearrangements are distinct, implying that the observed changes in fluorescence intensity are not the result of changes in the orientation of an inert &#x003b2;-barrel. However, the changes in <italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic> and in fluorescence intensity closely correlate in temporal dynamics, implying a close mechanistic connection between the FP reorientation and the change in fluorescence intensity.</p><p>The response amplitude of ArcLight increases if the fluorescent protein is inserted at positions along the linker closer to the S4 transmembrane domain <xref rid="pone.0113873-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> than in a position more C-terminal. In this study, we scanned the full linker region from A231 to S249 by inserting the super ecliptic pHluorin A227D after each of the linker amino acids. We determined that there is a &#x0201c;sweet spot&#x0201d; (Q239 to A242) in the length of this linker outside of which the response amplitude is decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This drop off is precipitous as the linker length is decreased and gradual as it is increased beyond the optimal. Three of these derivatives, I233, F234 and Y235, with the fluorescent protein inserted close to the S4 domain did not traffic well to the plasma membrane. We also found that removing the three extra amino acids, glycine, aspartic acid and proline (GDP) in the linker region of all ArcLight derivatives did not significantly affect the signal size but did slow the response of ArcLight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We explored several protein modifications which may change the mobility/orientation/dimerization of the FP in ArcLight. These included removing non-essential, flexible residues at the N- or C-termini of the super ecliptic pHluorin A227D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g007">Figure 7</xref>), adding an anchoring farnesylation site to the C-terminal end of the FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and using tandem super ecliptic pHluorin A227D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g009">Figure 9</xref>). None of these approaches has improved the probes response characteristics. Instead, these modifications tend to decrease the response amplitude and slow down the response kinetics of the probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g009">9</xref>). It is not clear why these modification cause deterioration of the ArcLight response properties.</p><p>The robust ArcLight fluorescent response may result from the modulatory effect of mutation A227D on the &#x003b2;-barrel structure of the FP, to which deformation may be induced by movement of the S1&#x02013;S4 domains. The loosening of the &#x003b2;-barrel in turn allows penetration by a H<sup>+</sup> ion, leading to fluorophore quenching analogous to that observed upon a pH change, and thus to a decrease in fluorescence intensity. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the observation that the fluorescent response is greatly reduced with ArcLight variants featuring obligatory intramolecular dimerization of FPs (tandem FPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g009">Figure 9</xref>) or fixation of the FP position (by farnesylation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113873-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Alternatively or concomitantly, ArcLight FPs may undergo a voltage dependent intermolecular dimerization and de-dimerization or association/disassociation with the plasma membrane. The hyperpolarization position of the S4 may allow FPs of two ArcLight subunits to dimerize, producing a fluorescent dimer. If this were true we would expect to see a membrane concentration dependent effect. Upon depolarization and net outward movement of the S4 domain, this dimerization may be disrupted, producing reduced output monomers. In fact, many other FPs are known to show reduced fluorescence output upon monomerization <xref rid="pone.0113873-Zacharias1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Alternatively depolarization dependent movements may reversibly alter the FPs association with the plasma membrane.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Leslie M.
