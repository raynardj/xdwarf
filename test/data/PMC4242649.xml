Clinical data from patient records comprised gender, age at onset, date of first endolaryngeal procedure with biopsy, date of last follow-up, total number of endolaryngeal procedures, and complications during the observation period. Disease was defined as juvenile (JoRRP) or adult onset (AoRRP) according to whether the disease was acquired before or after the age of 18. Aggressive disease was defined as distal spread, tracheostomy, four surgical operations annually or &#x0003e;10 surgeries in total. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. HPV genotyping was performed by quantitative PCR assay identifying 15 HPV genotypes. The study included 224 patients. The majority were males (141/174 in AoRRPs and 31/50 in JoRRPs; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005). The median follow-up from initial diagnosis was 12.0 years (IQR 3.7&#x02013;32.9) for JoRRPs and 4.0 years (IQR 0.8&#x02013;11.7) for AoRRPs. The disease was more aggressive in juveniles than adults (p&#x0003c;0.001), a difference that disappeared after 10 years' observation. JoRRPs with aggressive disease were younger at onset (mean difference 4.6 years, 95%CI [2.4, 6.8], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.009). HPV6 or &#x02212;11 was present in all HPV-positive papillomas. HPV11 was more prevalent in aggressive disease, and HPV6 in non-aggressive disease (p&#x0003c;0.001). Multiple logistic regression revealed that only age at onset (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.69, 95% CI [0.53, 0.88], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003) was associated with aggressive disease in juveniles, while HPV11 (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.74, 95% CI [1.40, 9.97], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.008) and observation time &#x0003e;10 years (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13.41, 95% CI [5.46, 32.99[, p&#x0003c;001) were risk factors in adults. In conclusion, the only significant risk factor for developing aggressive disease in JoRRPs was age at onset, but both HPV11 and observation time &#x0003e;10 years were risk factors for an aggressive disease course in AoRRPs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>These authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

According to the age at onset, two types of RRP are recognized; juvenile- (JoRRP) and adult-onset (AoRRP). Condylomas during pregnancy are considered the most important risk factor for acquiring JoRRP by vertical HPV transmission from mother to child <xref rid="pone.0113584-Silverberg1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In adults viral transmission may occur during oral sex <xref rid="pone.0113584-Kashima2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Ruiz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but re-activation of a latent HPV infection acquired in childhood is another possible cause <xref rid="pone.0113584-Kocjan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Currently there is no curable treatment for RRP and surgical procedures are required to improve voice quality and to prevent respiratory obstruction <xref rid="pone.0113584-Wiatrak1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Derkay1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The disease burden is high, and numerous hospital admissions are often necessary. The clinical course of RRP is unpredictable, frequently relapsing, and may be lifelong.</p><p>During the last two decades an increasing incidence of genital warts <xref rid="pone.0113584-Number1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113584-Simms1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0113584-Gillison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Jemal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> have been reported in the Western world. There is no surveillance of genital warts in Norway as there is in the UK and USA, but similar trends are reported in Scandinavia for both genital warts <xref rid="pone.0113584-Kjaer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and oropharyngeal carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0113584-Hammarstedt1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Mork1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. It is reasonable to expect similar trends in RRP, but currently we have no evidence of such <xref rid="pone.0113584-Campisi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Omland2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We do not know why only a very few of those exposed to HPV develop RRP. Furthermore, what causes an aggressive versus an indolent clinical course is unclear, but host genetic susceptibility and genetic variability in the viral genomes have been postulated <xref rid="pone.0113584-Buchinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is anticipated that the juvenile type is more aggressive than the adult type <xref rid="pone.0113584-Derkay2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Patients were identified through hospital registry systems, and their records were reviewed by two laryngologists. Only patients with histopathologically-verified laryngeal papillomatosis were included. Clinical records and histological reports were reviewed.

Onset of the disease was defined as the first date when RRP was verified histopathologically. Complications such as tracheostomies and synecias were recorded. To provide an overall assessment of disease severity, patients were categorized as having &#x02018;aggressive&#x02019; or &#x02018;non-aggressive&#x02019; disease. Aggressive disease was defined as the presence of any of the following criteria: &#x02265;10 total procedures, &#x02265;4 procedures per year at any time, distal spread (involvement of the trachea or lung), or ever had tracheostomy. If none of these criteria were met, the patient was considered to have non-aggressive disease. This binomial classification and definition is based on data from Doyle <italic>et al.</italic>

Fourteen patients were excluded from the study since paraffin blocks for HPV genotyping were not available. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences in gender, age at diagnosis or duration of observation time in the 14 excluded patients compared to the study population. In the 224 patients included in the analysis, 50 were JoRRPs and 174 were AoRRPs. The majority of patients were male: 141 (81%) in AoRRPs and 31 (62%) in JoRRPs (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005). Median age at onset for juveniles and adults was 4.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0&#x02013;6.0, maximum 17 years) and 34.0 years (IQR, 27.5&#x02013;43.0, maximum 85 years), respectively. The individual observation time varied over a wide range. JoRRPs were observed at a median of 12.9 years after initial diagnosis (IQR, 3.7&#x02013;32.9, maximum 62.2 years). AoRRPs had a median follow-up of 4.0 years (IQR, 0.8&#x02013;11.7, maximum 45.7 years) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113584-t002">Table 2</xref>). The number of surgical operations per year during the observation time did not differ between AoRRP and JoRRP, but a significantly higher frequency of operations was observed in JoRRPs during the first three years after onset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113584-t002">Table 2</xref>). Staging scores, both at onset and at the time of maximum extent of the disease during the observation period, showed a more extensive spread in JoRRPs than AoRRPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113584-t002">Table 2</xref>). Due to the wide variation in the duration of observation, patients were stratified by observation time (&#x0003c;10 years or &#x02265;10 years). The observed differences in clinical course between JoRRPs and AoRRPs remained significant (data not shown).

<xref rid="pone.0113584-Pou1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and Aaltonen <xref rid="pone.0113584-Aaltonen2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, which include HPV genotyping by PCR. Two studies included both age groups, but without comparing the two groups in terms of HPV genotype or clinical course <xref rid="pone.0113584-Sanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Kashima2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>As reported previously <xref rid="pone.0113584-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, our study confirmed that JoRRPs are more severely affected by frequent surgery, complications and distal spread of the disease compared with AoRRPs. Additionally, we found that young age at onset among juveniles was associated with aggressive disease, consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0113584-Buchinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Silverberg2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Reeves1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Age at onset in adults was not associated with an aggressive clinical course, in contrast to the findings of Aaltonen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113584-Aaltonen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> who found young age at onset to be a significant risk factor for disease severity. Their outcome measure was the total number of surgical operations, without correction for widely varying observation time. We used the number of operations per year as one outcome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113584-t002">Table 2</xref>), but also included four possible criteria for aggressive disease and stratified the outcome results by observation time with a cut-off point of ten years.</p><p>Furthermore, our study shows that when the observation time exceeds ten years, the differences in aggressiveness between juveniles and adults disappear, though not for distal spread, which is more pronounced in juveniles regardless of disease duration. Moreover, we observed that in adults the maximum extent of the disease may progress after onset, while in juveniles it does not increase. This is in accordance with the operation frequency in adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113584-t002">Table 2</xref>), which is significantly higher during the entire observation time than in the first three years. This may be explained by a different approach to treatment: juveniles have surgeries scheduled every 4&#x02013;5 weeks until the papillomas regress. In adults, the approach is more pragmatic, with surgery scheduled only when the patient has complained of hoarseness. Many adult patients are accustomed to being hoarse and therefore may wait an unnecessarily long time before seeking medical advice.</p><p>Several publications have shown that HPV11 is one of the most important risk factors for developing an aggressive clinical course <xref rid="pone.0113584-Draganov1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Donne1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Wiatrak1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Maloney1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113584-Pou1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, but this finding has not been consistently replicated <xref rid="pone.0113584-PenalozaPlascencia1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Buchinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Gabbott1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Padayachee1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Additionally, HPV11 appears more frequently in children than in adults <xref rid="pone.0113584-Pou1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Aaltonen2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, such that is difficult to conclude whether the aggressiveness in juveniles is driven by HPV11 <italic>per se</italic> or whether HPV11 represents a confounder to an unknown susceptibility in children, e.g. an immature immunological response. Regarding the distribution of HPV6 and HPV11, there was a trend of a higher proportion of HPV11 in juveniles and HPV6 in adults. These differences did not reach significance level (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.054), which may be due to the small sample size. Our figures showed that HPV11 occurred more frequently with aggressive versus non-aggressive disease (p&#x0003c;0.001). However, when stratified for juveniles and adults, the difference in the distribution of HPV6 or HPV11 was significant only in adults (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004). This is supported by the logistic regression model, which showed age at onset to be the only significant risk factor for aggressive disease in juveniles, whereas in adults both HPV11 and observation time &#x02265;10 years were significant.</p><p>Another aspect of the difference in the HPV genotype distribution between JoRRPs and AoRRPs is that it is consistent with the hypothesis that there are different modes of viral transmission in adults versus juveniles. If HPV virus acquired in childhood is reactivated in adulthood, we would expect to find the same HPV profile in AoRRPs and JoRRPs. Hence, a different distribution of HPV6 and HPV11 between AoRRPs and JoRRPs supports the concept of vertical HPV transmission from mother to child in JoRRPs <xref rid="pone.0113584-Silverberg1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> while AoRRPs are infected in adulthood, possibly during oral sex <xref rid="pone.0113584-Kashima2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113584-Ruiz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>As far as we know, there is no standardized staging or assessment system for RRP. In contrast to the staging system proposed by Derkay <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113584-Derkay3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, where clinical course is included, our assessment system does not implicate criteria other than the anatomical extent of the disease. Our assessment is also less detailed, resulting in a simplified scoring. We believe that a detailed staging system such as that of Derkay and colleagues is useful for the surgeon to evaluate whether the disease has progressed when scheduling surgery. In research, subtle changes between each surgical procedure will probably be difficult to detect, as reflected in the study of Altonen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113584-Aaltonen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> in which neither symptoms nor size and number of lesions was predictive of the clinical disease course.</p><p>The limitation of our study lies in the retrospective sampling of data from patient records. We assume correct and accurate data, but we cannot rule out information bias. Moreover, the staging score was only registered at the time of disease onset and at the time of maximum extent of the disease. We were able to register the operation frequency, but we did not have complete data to register the date and staging score for each surgical intervention, which would have given an even more detailed picture of the clinical course.</p><p>As in most follow up studies it is a common problem that patients are given treatment that may influence the endpoints, such as Cidofovir treatment in this study. Additionally, risk factors that are studied may also potentially influence whether the patients are given treatment or not. This problem can not be resolved by statistical methods or excluding patients and this is one of the reasons why follow-up studies are less reliable than randomized studies.</p><p>The strength of our method is that this was a relatively large cohort of both AoRRPs and JoRRPs, with patients enrolled from only two hospitals, thus reducing the likelihood of information bias.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The clinical course of RRP in juveniles is more severe than in adults. There is a higher rate of HPV11 genotype compared to HPV6 among patients with an aggressive disease course compared to non-aggressive disease. In AoRRPs, the risk factors related to aggressive disease were HPV11 genotype and observation time exceeding 10 years, while in JoRRPs only age at onset was of significance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Jens &#x000d8;yvind Loven MD, Chair of Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital, Oslo, who contributed patients to this study and Jon Mork MD Ph.D, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Oslo University Hospital, for his helpfulness and advice.
