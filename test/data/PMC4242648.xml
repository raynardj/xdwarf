Understanding subpopulation dynamics is therefore central for both optimization of existing therapy and for development of new treatment. The aim of this study was to isolate subpopulations from a primary tumor and by comparing molecular characteristics of these subpopulations, find explanations to their differing tumorigenicity. Cell subpopulations from two patient derived <italic>in vivo</italic> models of primary breast cancer, ER+ and ER-, were identified. EpCAM+ cells from the ER+ model gave rise to tumors independently of stroma cell support. The tumorigenic fraction was further divided based on SSEA-4 and CD24 expression. Both markers were expressed in ER+ breast cancer biopsies. FAC-sorted cells based on EpCAM, SSEA-4 and CD24 expression were subsequently tested for differences in functionality by <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity assay. Three out of four subpopulations of cells were tumorigenic and showed variable ability to recapitulate the marker expression of the original tumor. Whole genome expression analysis of the sorted populations disclosed high similarity in the transcriptional profiles between the tumorigenic populations. Comparing the non-tumorigenic vs the tumorigenic populations, 44 transcripts were, however, significantly differentially expressed. A subset of these, 26 identified and named genes, highly expressed in the non-tumorigenic population, predicted longer overall survival (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;737, p&#x0003c;0.0001) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1379, p&#x0003c;0.0001) when performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using the GOBO online database. The 26 gene set correlated with longer DMFS in multiple breast cancer subgroups. Copy number profiling revealed no aberrations that could explain the observed differences in tumorigenicity. This study emphasizes the functional variability among cell populations that are otherwise genomically similar, and that the risk of breast cancer recurrence can only be eliminated if the tumorigenic abilities in multiple cancer cell subpopulations are inhibited.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was financially supported by the Norwegian South East Health Authorities (to TS and NS), the Norwegian Cancer Society, and the Norwegian Research Council (through SFI-CAST to GMM, TS, NS and KA), and by the K.G.

To understand how some cancer cells are able to escape and cause recurrence, researchers have compared primary tumors to small ecosystems where the extracellular components determine the physical environment, and all cell populations, both normal and neoplastic, represent the diversity of the species within the system <xref rid="pone.0113278-Hendrix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Merlo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Large intratumoral cellular diversity ensures that at least one tumor cell subpopulation is able to tolerate the altered conditions, during treatment, or relocation to a metastatic site <xref rid="pone.0113278-Merlo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Maley1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Our challenge is to understand why heterogeneity is sustained in the developing tumor, and how to best eradicate dynamically changing cancer cell populations before they develop strategies to withstand attacks from various treatment. Details of cancer cell population dynamics is obviously not possible to study in tissue derived directly from patients. The best option is therefore, clinically representative patient derived xenograft models (PDX), that has not been subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> culture differentiation or selection <xref rid="pone.0113278-Merlino1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Such models provide stable access to primary tumor material enabling repeated experiments on the same primary tumor, and thus broad characterization of tumor cell subpopulations. PDX stably recapitulate the molecular composition and the heterogeneity of the mother tumor <xref rid="pone.0113278-Merlino1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Marangoni1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The luminal-like PDX used in this study is unique in that it recapitulates estrogen dependency for growth <xref rid="pone.0113278-Bergamaschi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Huuse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Although intratumor heterogeneity is well established, its origin has been heavily debated. The clonal evolution model was counteracted by the theory of &#x0201c;cancer stem cells&#x0201d; or tumor initiating cells, TICs. Several studies in cell lines <xref rid="pone.0113278-Patrawala1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and animal models <xref rid="pone.0113278-AlHajj1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Ginestier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> have indeed indicated the existence of tumor cell subpopulations with enhanced tumorigenic capacity, compared to the &#x0201c;bulk&#x0201d; tumor cells. Regardless of the origin of TIC populations, identification and functional characterization of both TICs and the seemingly less tumorigenic subpopulations are essential for development of more efficient anti-cancer therapies. It is important to consider that within the ecosystem of a tumor, the TICs and the apparently less tumorigenic cancer cell populations might in fact be equally dependent on each other <xref rid="pone.0113278-Cleary1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Less tumorigenic populations might constitute a reservoir for development of treatment resistance. Clarification of the reciprocal relationships between cell populations within breast tumors, and the dynamics of their differentiation, is therefore needed. The aim of this study was to find phenotypically different subpopulations within a primary tumor that could initiate tumor growth independently of each other, and by comparing molecular characteristics of these subpopulations, find explanations to their diverging capacity. Another objective was to acquire detailed knowledge on functional differences, cell surface marker expression, and molecular portraits of tumorigenic subpopulations within a primary breast cancer model, to open the possibility for future, controlled studies of cancer cell population dynamics and cellular plasticity in response to changing conditions. In the present manuscript, subpopulations from two uniquely well characterized PDX models <xref rid="pone.0113278-Bergamaschi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Huuse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Grinde1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Lindholm1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Lindholm2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Moestue1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> were therefore defined, and their cellular surface marker composition was elucidated.

To this end, dissociated single cells from both xenografts were stained with EpCAM in combination with a number of markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113278-t002">Table 2</xref>) and IHC analysis of sectioned xenograft tumors was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113278.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Of all the tested markers, CD24, SSEA-4, SSEA-1 (CD15) CXCR4, E-cadherin and CD44v6 were expressed on the EpCAM positive population of the tumorigenic luminal-like xenograft cells, and thus candidates for defining functionally different luminal tumor cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113278-t002">Table 2</xref>). To test whether the candidate antibodies were specifically anti&#x02013;human, dissociated cells from the luminal-like xenograft were double-stained using anti-EpCAM or anti-TRA-1-85 in combination with either of the markers of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113278-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This experiment revealed that expression of some of the markers did not define subpopulations, as all human cells were recognized (CD49b, CD31, CD166). CD44v6 expression was excluded due to variable expression caused by the enzymatic digestion of the tumors <xref rid="pone.0113278-Hines1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. SSEA-1 was excluded due to expression also in the basal-like model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113278-t002">Table 2</xref>) in which dissociated cells in suspension showed very low tumorigenicity.

A two group comparison using t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113278-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) revealed 44 differentially expressed transcripts (p&#x02264;0.004, FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20), of which 6 genes were less expressed in the dbl.high compared to the other populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113278-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113278-t003">Table 3</xref>). The online database &#x0201c;Gene expression-Based Outcome for Breast Cancer&#x0201d; (GOBO) <xref rid="pone.0113278-Ringner1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> was used to test the association between the set of genes highly expressed in the non-tumorigenic population with outcome for 1881 breast cancer patients. 26 genes from the 44-list were both highly expressed in dbl.high cells and represented in the GOBO database. In tumors, high expression of the 26 genes, correlated significantly with longer overall survival (OS) (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;737, p&#x0003c;0.0001) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1379, p&#x0003c;0.0001) in Kaplan-Meier analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113278-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The 26 gene set, furthermore, correlated with longer DMFS in multiple subgroups of the 1881 sample breast cancer dataset; in basal-like, ER-negative, LN-negative, as well as in grade 2 tumors, high expression of the 26 genes predicted lower risk of recurrent disease and longer DMFS. RT-qPCR validation confirmed the stringency of the FACS procedure and microarray gene expression analysis. This was exemplified by the CD24 gene which was found highly expressed in the CD24 expressing populations, both by microarray analysis and by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113278-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0113278-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113278.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Whole genome expression analyses of sorted tumor cell subpopulations.

Studies of non-genetic molecular variations and correlations with tumorigenic abilities (functional heterogeneity) are, due to limited supply of material, literally impossible to perform in clinical samples. The intratumor heterogeneity of a representative PDX model was therefore explored. Clinically relevant cell surface markers were used to prospectively define four subpopulations, and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional heterogeneity was measured. Finally, transcriptional and genomic characteristics were analysed with emphasis on differences between the populations that could potentially explain their divergent <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity.</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> assays were performed as four separate biological parallels, and the purity and viability of the fractions were controlled before each injection. Even though the common genetic origin of the four populations was confirmed by the copy number analyses, no tumors were formed after any of the injections of the dbl.high (CD24<sup>high</sup>/SSEA4<sup>high</sup>) fractions suggesting that this cell population had a lower intrinsic tumorigenic potential than the others. Interestingly, tumors resulting from injections of pure dbl.low - and pure CD24<sup>high</sup> cells were, when re-analyzed by flow, always similar to the original PDX tumor. In other words, cells expressing neither of the cell surface markers, or only CD24, had the ability to form offspring containing all four subpopulations, and did so every time. Conversely, cells expressing only the SSEA-4 marker, although tumorigenic, were never able to regenerate all four subpopulations in the resulting tumors. Altogether, these results indicate that the TICs in the SSEA-4<sup>high</sup> population were different from the TICs in dbl.low and CD24<sup>high</sup> populations. We therefore hypothesize that tumor initiating cells from this PDX had more than one phenotype, and the TICs within each subpopulation did not vary from experiment to experiment. In line with this, it has been shown that from the same cell line, both phenotypically pure luminal-like cells as well as their more stem cell-like counterparts could give rise to tumors <xref rid="pone.0113278-LethLarsen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113278-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This PDX model, always regenerates the four defined subpopulations of the original PDX when routinely implanted as small tumor tissue pieces in MFP, and the morphological characteristics, receptor status and transcriptional profile are stable over multiple passages <xref rid="pone.0113278-Bergamaschi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, the SSEA-4<sup>high</sup> population does probably not dominate over the dbl.low or CD24<sup>high</sup> population; otherwise, the CD24 expression would, over time, be lost. Considering that SSEA-4 is regarded as a stem cell marker, this result was unexpected. One possible explanation might be that CD24 expression was redundant for developing new tumors from the SSEA-4<sup>high</sup> cells, or that the daughter cells had lost their ability to differentiate along the luminal-epithelial lineage, and hence did not express CD24. It is tempting to speculate that cells expressing SSEA-4 could be locked into myoepithelial differentiation.</p><p>From the tumorigenicity assays and re-analysis of the resulting tumors, it was clear that the four subpopulations represented three different functional phenotypes; the non-tumorigeic, the PDX recapitulating, and the tumorigenic but non-CD24 recapitulating. In search for transcriptional patterns explaining the functional phenotypes, whole genome expression analysis was performed. Corresponding well with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, the dbl.high cell population was the population that seemed to be most different from the others. Collectively, the genes differentially expressed in this population compared to the other cell populations, do not point to a specific tumor inhibiting function or cellular target. It is therefore interesting that when using the genes highly expressed in the non-tumorigenic population as a marker for patient stratification in the online GOBO database, patients with high expression of this gene set experienced improved overall survival and distant metastasis free survival in a multivariate analysis. This finding is in concordance with our <italic>in vivo</italic> functional data, and suggests that the genes highly expressed in the non-tumorigenic cells may affect tumorigenicity when highly expressed in clinical samples. Although, high expression of the 26 genes set in primary breast cancer cells seemed to indicate less aggressive cancer, it does not necessarily indicate expression of the two cell surface markers.</p><p>SNP arrays were employed to delineate whether copy number alterations were specifically assigned to each population. Interestingly, genomic heterogeneity within each population was revealed, indicating that the CD24 and SSEA-4 based FAC-sorting did enrich for functional phenotypes, but perhaps not for underlying genetic aberrations. It is possible that transcriptional differences between the TICs within each subpopulation might be camouflaged by transcription from intermixed less tumorigenic cells. It is also possible that the tumor initiating capacity might be better explained by differences in the post-transcriptional or protein regulation mechanisms. The clinical impact of the genes highly expressed in the dbl.high non-tumorigenic population may indicate that the observed phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within this tumor most likely does not result from genetic changes. Recently, Snuderl and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0113278-Snuderl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> explored the genetic intratumoral heterogeneity of glioblastomas. In a comment to their work <xref rid="pone.0113278-Ene1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, different scenarios for interactions between cellular subclones within tumors were discussed. Data presented here suggest that in this particular model, a so-called &#x0201c;random&#x0201d; scenario, where subclones of cancer cells survive autonomously, is the most probable. While one population could not give rise to new tumors, three populations were tumorigenic, independently of each other, and independently of stroma cells. Intriguingly, the three tumorigenic subpopulations, also gave rise to two phenotypically different types of daughter tumors, implying possible functional variations between the resulting tumors. This study emphasizes the need for broad attacks against multiple subpopulations within the primary tumor to obtain systemic eradication of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113278.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Growth curves of tumors resulting from injection of 10<sup>5</sup> FAC-sorted cells from the luminal-like PDX in the MFP of NSG mice.
