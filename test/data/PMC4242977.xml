Within the USA, it has been estimated that at least 116 million US adults suffer from chronic pain, with an estimated annual national economic cost of $560&#x02013;635 billion. While pain is in part a sensory process, like sight, touch, or smell, pain is also in part an emotional experience, like depression, anxiety, or anger.

The BHI 2 is a standardized psychometric measure, with three validity measures, 16 clinical scales, and a multidimensional assessment of pain. This article will review how the BHI 2 was developed, BHI 2 concepts, validation research, and an overview of the description and interpretation of its scales. Like all measures, the BHI 2 has strengths and weaknesses of which the forensic psychologist should be aware, and particular purposes for which it is best suited. Guided by that knowledge, the BHI 2 can play a useful role in the forensic psychologist&#x02019;s toolbox.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd><kwd>Psychological assessment</kwd><kwd>Psychological evaluation</kwd><kwd>Psychological screen</kwd><kwd>Forensic</kwd><kwd>Litigation</kwd><kwd>Battery for Health Improvement 2</kwd><kwd>Brief Battery for Health Improvement 2</kwd><kwd>BHI 2</kwd><kwd>BBHI 2</kwd><kwd>Presurgical</kwd><kwd>Treatment outcome</kwd><kwd>Standardized test</kwd><kwd>Opioid risk</kwd><kwd>Health psychology</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Risk</kwd><kwd>Suicide</kwd><kwd>Violence</kwd><kwd>Litigiousness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="Par2">Pain is the most common reason why patients see a physician: <italic>Something hurts</italic> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>; National Center for Health Statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1992</xref>). Thus, the presence of pain is a primary driving force that underlies the demand for health care. Within the USA, it has been estimated that at least 116 million US adults suffer from chronic pain, with an estimated annual national economic cost of $560&#x02013;635 billion (Institute of Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2011</xref>). Chronic pain is also closely associated with disability (Ehde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2003</xref>; Zale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2013</xref>). In 2012, 10.8 million persons were receiving Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), at the cost of $128 billion annually, not including the associated costs of Medicare (Congressional Budget Office <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). Of SSDI recipients in 2011, 44&#x000a0;% were prescribed opioid pain relievers (Morden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">A recent report from the Institute of Medicine studied the problem of pain in the USA. It concluded that pain has biological, psychological, and social components, and effective treatments for pain must address all three of these components. This report stated that &#x0201c;effective pain management is a moral imperative, a professional responsibility, and the duty of people in the healing professions&#x0201d; (Institute of Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2011</xref>;&#x000a0;p. S-3). The International Association for the Study of Pain has affirmed the biopsychosocial nature of pain and concluded that pain has a dual nature. While pain is in part a sensory process, like sight, touch, or smell, pain is also in part an emotional experience, like depression, anxiety, or anger (Merskey and Bogduk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">1994</xref>). At the neurophysiological level, the experience of pain is inextricably linked with physiological arousal, mood, memory, and cognition (Apkarian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>; Melzack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2001</xref>). Thus, chronic pain represents the quintessential biopsychosocial condition.</p><p id="Par4">One of the challenges of treating patients with chronic pain is that pain leads to increased demand for opioid medication to suppress the pain, and surgical interventions to &#x0201c;fix&#x0201d; the pain. Unfortunately, due to pain&#x02019;s complex nature, iatrogenic complications are common. One study examined the number of unintentional deaths in the USA from prescription opioid pain medications and found that it exceeds the number of deaths due to cocaine and heroin combined (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>). Another study examining the effects of surgical treatments for patients with spinal pain found that while an objectively successful fusion occurred in 84&#x000a0;% of lumbar fusion patients, nearly half were dissatisfied with their outcome, and many were totally disabled at follow-up (LaCaille et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2005</xref>). Because pain treatments such as these can lead to iatrogenic complications, these treatments can be both costly and counter-productive.</p><p id="Par5">The study by LaCaille and colleagues above illustrates an important conclusion of another study. In many cases, orthopedic surgeries for chronic pain are performed when the primary outcome goals are to change behavior: to induce the patient to say, &#x0201c;My pain is much better,&#x0201d; to say, &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t need opioids anymore,&#x0201d; to report satisfaction with health care, or to return to work (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). While medical imaging techniques are helpful for making objective diagnoses, these imaging techniques were not designed to assess feelings or predict behavior. Consequently,&#x000a0;pain self-reports cannot be replaced by neuroimaging or other technologies (Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2013</xref>). Given the prominent psychological component of chronic pain, the advice of Hippocrates is especially apt: &#x0201c;It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease, than to know what sort of disease a person has&#x0201d; (Hippocrates, 400 BCE). Thus, since chronic pain is known to be a complex, biopsychosocial condition, a prerequisite of effective pain treatment is accurate assessment of not only the medical aspects of pain but also the psychosocial aspects as well.</p><p id="Par6">Psychological interventions for chronic pain have been shown to be safe and effective treatments for pain (Hoffman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2007</xref>) but are generally underutilized (Robbins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2003</xref>). Studies have shown that psychological treatments combined with exercise can produce improvements in functioning that equal those of surgery for back pain (Brox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>; Chou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2009</xref>). The economic benefits of a treatment model that integrated psychological services was tested in a 15-year longitudinal study of 29 million patients, which provided evidence that a biopsychosocial model for treating pain and injury provided better care at less cost (Bruns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012b</xref>). This model relied heavily on psychological assessments for treatment planning.</p><p id="Par7">An extensive review of the evidence determined that psychological tests are the scientific equal of medical tests (G. J. Meyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2001</xref>) and can sometimes exceed the ability of medical tests to predict the outcome of medical treatments for pain (Carragee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>; Carragee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). Due to the overwhelming evidence for the biopsychosocial nature of pain and the value of psychological assessments, the majority of chronic pain guidelines recommend a psychological evaluation as an integral part of the diagnostic workup (Bruns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">in press</xref>). These guidelines create a mandate for both clinical and forensic psychological evaluations of chronic pain.</p><p id="Par8">Psychological assessments for medical patients serve a number of purposes. These include providing an accurate means of describing a medical patient&#x02019;s mental status, medical symptoms, traits, attitudes, abilities, and the patient&#x02019;s perception of the social environment. This in turn can facilitate making determinations about how to diagnose or classify the patient, plan interventions, predict outcome, and measure change (Bruns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">in press</xref>; Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>; Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2001</xref>). One biopsychosocial inventory designed for the assessment of patients with chronic pain is the Battery for Health Improvement 2 (BHI 2) (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>). The BHI 2 is a standardized psychometric measure, a primary purpose of which is to perform clinical and forensic evaluations of patients with pain and injury. This article will provide an overview of how the BHI 2 was developed, BHI 2 interpretive concepts, and the nature and validation of its scales.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Overview of the BHI 2</title><p id="Par9">The goal of the BHI 2 development was to create a comprehensive biopsychosocial inventory to assess medical patients with pain and/or injury specifically, and somatic symptom disorders more generally. Consequently, the BHI 2 is best conceptualized not as a psychological inventory, but rather as a biopsychosocial inventory.</p><p id="Par10">A brief review of the BHI 2&#x02019;s development and validation process (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>) is as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par11">The BHI 2 originated with a paradigm called the vortex model, which is a graphical representation of the biopsychosocial model as it pertains to the onset of injury, illness, chronic pain, and intractable biopsychosocial disorders (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This model attempted to organize what was known about how patients respond to health challenges, and why some patients get into a &#x0201c;downward spiral&#x0201d; of worsening symptoms. The vortex model served as a guide for BHI 2 development, and as a conceptual paradigm for performing a biopsychosocial evaluation in the clinical setting.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Vortex Paradigm from which the BHI 2 was developed</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12207_2014_9206_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Development of the BHI 2 began when, based on this biopsychosocial paradigm, over 1,100 items were generated, of which 600 were selected for empirical assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">The 600 selected&#x000a0;items were administered to 2,507 subjects gathered from 106 sites in 36 US states, along with a number of other measures.

Additionally, fake good and fake bad groups were also obtained.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">The scales to develop were identified through a review of the literature and were represented in the vortex paradigm. The BHI 2&#x02019;s scales are organized in accordance with the biopsychosocial model, and the content of the scales and items were developed to represent the various aspects of the paradigm.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Items were assigned to the 18 BHI 2 scales based on the appropriateness of the item content, and the ability of the item to differentiate one group of subjects from another, item to scale correlations, item to criteria correlations, and resultant scale to criteria correlations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">The BHI 2 development process produced three validity measures (Validity Items (random responding), Self-Disclosure, and Defensiveness), &#x0201c;biological&#x0201d; scales assessing medical symptoms (Somatic Complaints, Pain Complaints, Functional Complaints, and Muscular Bracing), psychological measures&#x000a0;of affect and characterological dysfunction&#x000a0; (Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Borderline, Symptom Dependency, Chronic Maladjustment, Substance Abuse, and Perseverance), and measures of the patient&#x02019;s social environment (Family Dysfunction, Doctor Dissatisfaction, Survivor of Violence, and Job Dissatisfaction). At cross-validation, the mean test-retest reliability and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of the BHI 2 scales were .93 and .84, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">The development process also yielded 40 content-based subscales. Items were assigned to these subscales based on the appropriateness of the item content as determined by the opinion of a panel of 12 expert judges. The description of these scales goes beyond the scope of this paper. However, the content validity established by this method supported the content validity of the parent scale of which the subscale is a part. The mean test-retest reliability, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, and interjudge agreement regarding item content of the BHI 2 content-based subscales were .88, .69, and .92, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Following the completion of the test development process, the BHI 2 has been the subject of numerous peer-reviewed studies about various matters of clinical interest.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">Because the BHI 2 scales were validated in different ways, validity is a more complex topic and will be discussed on a scale-by-scale basis below.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par23">Along with tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-RF (Ben-Porath and Tellegen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>), the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (Millon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">1997</xref>), and the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (Millon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2001</xref>), the BHI 2 has been listed as a commonly used test for patients with chronic pain in multiple medical treatment guidelines (American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>; California Division of Workers' Compensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>; Colorado Division of Workers' Compensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>; Oklahoma Physician Advisory Committee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2007</xref>; Work Loss Data Institute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2009</xref>), has been integrated into clinical protocols (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>), and was favorably peer reviewed by the Buros Center for Testing (Vitelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2007</xref>). This review concluded that the BHI 2 could benefit from&#x000a0;further studies about validity assessment and malingering, and longitudinal studies about medical treatment outcome. Despite these weaknesses, the review concluded that &#x0201c;the reliability and validity research of the BHI 2 demonstrates that it is one of the best instruments available for assessing the broad range of treatment needs in clinical populations&#x0201d; (Vitelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2007</xref>; p. 75).</p><p id="Par24">At the time of this writing, the BHI 2 or Brief BHI 2 (BBHI 2) has been accepted as evidence in several US federal court cases (Chambers v. Astrue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>; Cowgar v. Commissioner Of Social Security Administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>; Cowger v. Astrue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>; Davis v. Astrue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>; Lewis v. Astrue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2012</xref>; Webb v. Astrue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2009</xref>). The short version of the BHI 2, the Brief Battery for Health Improvement 2 (BBHI 2), has been accepted as evidence in one US federal case (McGuire v. Astrue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2008</xref>). Although the BHI 2 and BBHI 2 have been accepted as evidence in federal courts, there have been no specific judicial rulings pertaining to the tests themselves. However, in one case, one psychologist&#x02019;s testimony was determined to be more persuasive than that of a second psychologist due to the fact that the first psychologist had performed validity testing, which included the BHI 2 scales (<italic>Webb v. Astrue</italic>). In two other cases, testimony was given that the BHI 2 &#x0201c;is a more sophisticated test&#x0201d; than the Beck Depression Inventory (<italic>Cowgar v. Commissioner Of Social Security Administration</italic>; <italic>Cowger v. Astrue</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bidirectional Scales and the Interpretation of Low Scores</title><p id="Par26">Many human traits and symptoms are more or less normally distributed, and scores that deviate from the mean in either the high or low direction are equally &#x0201c;abnormal&#x0201d; in the statistical sense. Similar to measures of cognitive ability, where both high and low scores are meaningful, some measures of mood or personality also return a near normal distribution of scores, where high and low scores are of equal significance (McCrae et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2010</xref>; Russell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2002</xref>). Scales which produce meaningful high and low scores are sometimes called &#x0201c;bipolar scales&#x0201d; (Widiger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2011</xref>), but to avoid confusion with the diagnosis of the same name, the term &#x0201c;bidirectional scales&#x0201d; will be preferred here. Recent research has suggested that conceptualizing psychological measures as being unidirectional may be mistaken, as maladaptive traits can be observed in patients with scores at both ends of a scale&#x02019;s distribution (Pettersson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2014</xref>). For example, one study concluded that on a neuroticism scale (measuring high negative affectivity), a low score was suggestive of the glib and fearless traits seen in psychopaths. Thus, both very high and very low scores on this scale were indicative of psychological dysfunction (Widiger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">Bidirectional scales would appear to be of particular interest in the assessment of patients with chronic pain, or somatoform or somatic symptom disorders. This is because unusually low scores on some measures may suggest denial or suppressed report, and numerous studies have associated cognitive and emotional suppression with heightened psychophysiological reactivity and symptom report.</p><p id="Par28">Studies have found that thought suppression increases the occurrence of obsessive ruminations about the very subject that the patient is trying to ignore (Wegner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">1994</xref>; Wegner and Lane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2002</xref>). The avoidance of talking about strong feelings or important experiences has also been associated with autonomic arousal. For example, studies have found that suppressed anger increased blood pressure more than manifest anger (Vogele et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">1997</xref>) and is also associated with increased pain (Quartana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2010</xref>). The suppression of negative emotions is also associated with compromised functioning of the immune system (Petrie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2002</xref>; Petrie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">1998</xref>), while emotional inhibition and reports of unusually low stress are associated with elevated levels of muscular bracing and myofascial pain (Traue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2002</xref>). Other studies have demonstrated that emotional repression predicts poor outcome following multidisciplinary treatment for chronic pain (Burns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>), higher levels of cardiac reactivity (Burns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1999</xref>), hypertension (Gleiberman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>), and with behavioral signs of anxiety (Giese-Davis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2014</xref>). A factor analytic study of patients with chronic pain identified one factor consisting of patients with high pain and disability but an absence of emotional distress (Burns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>). Patients who suppress emotions are also less likely to recall undesirable information about their health (Millar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2006</xref>). Overall, while the interpretation of low scores is the cornerstone of neuropsychological assessment, the interpretation of low scores/low reports is often overlooked when assessing patients with chronic pain.</p><p id="Par29">Diagnostically, unusually low affective reports have been associated with a personality construct called &#x0201c;alexithymia,&#x0201d; meaning &#x0201c;without words for feelings&#x0201d; (Sifneos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">1996</xref>). Research has established that alexithymia includes difficulty identifying or describing feelings, externally oriented thinking, and a limited capacity for imagination (Lumley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2007</xref>). Two studies have concluded that there is a consistent link between alexithymia and somatization (Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>; Bailey and Henry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>), while other studies concluded that alexithymia contributes to the emergence of somatic symptoms in major depression (Gulec et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>), to somatization after brain injury (Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2009</xref>), to unrecognized affective distress associated with pain (Lumley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2002</xref>), to increased illness behavior (Lumley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">1997</xref>), and to stronger electrodermal response in biofeedback (Friedlander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1997</xref>). This relationship between alexithymia and somatization was also supported by the findings of a large population study (Mattila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2008</xref>). Although neither the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>), DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>), nor the ICD-10 (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">2010</xref>) mentions alexithymia, all note that some somatizing patients may exhibit unexpectedly low levels of affective distress, which is consistent with the above.</p><p id="Par30">As an example of the effects of unrecognized affective distress, a patient who is having an anxiety attack could state emphatically that the symptoms are not due to severe stress or anxiety and instead assert that she/he is having a heart attack. In such a scenario, the patient may report extremely high physical distress but deny or be unaware of the emotional origins of the symptom. The research reviewed above suggests that the denial of the affective component may actually increase the somatic component of the symptoms, and this suggests a need for the assessment of low affective&#x000a0;scores.</p><p id="Par31">Although some of the BHI 2 scales exhibit a truncated distribution of scores below the mean, and a positive skew (e.g., Pain Complaints, Substance Abuse, and Survivor of Violence), some are close to being normally distributed, with other scales exhibiting a negative skew (e.g., Defensiveness, Anxiety, and Perseverance) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). One BHI 2 scale, Perseverance, is negatively skewed to the degree that negative T scores are possible (which occurs when a T score is more than 5 standard deviations below the mean). Statistically, scores which are 5 standard deviations below the mean are just as &#x0201c;abnormal&#x0201d; as scores which are 5 standard deviations above, and the studies reviewed above suggest that such unusually low scores might be as clinically meaningful as high ones. The interpretation of such low scores is sometimes less clear, though.

</p><p id="Par32">While moderately low scores on the BHI 2 or other psychological measures may reflect that the patient is coping unusually well, as scores become very low or extremely low, a different type of adjustment problem may be indicated. For example, an utter absence of any perceived affective distress could be explained as being attributable to extraordinary resilience, or alternately to psychopathy, alexithymia, denial, or dissociation. In the clinical setting, as each of these alternatives is associated with different behaviors, behavioral observations and the patient&#x02019;s history might be needed to help determine which interpretation is correct.</p><p id="Par33">On all of the BHI 2 scales, the lowest possible raw score is 0, and this can be a useful benchmark in interpretation. For example, in order for a patient to receive a raw score of 0 on Hostility, the patient must have strongly disagreed with 16 items having to do with anger. If, in an interview, a patient denied ever having any angry thoughts, feelings, or behaviors 16 times, it would seem remarkable. Consequently, scores this low on the BHI 2 are empirically unusual, and often intuitively and clinically meaningful. Even so, the interpretation of low psychological scales scores is often problematic.</p><p id="Par34">A final caveat here is that as a rule, there is far less research on psychological measures about the interpretation of low scores as opposed to high scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>BHI 2 Interpretation Using Multiple Norm Groups</title><p id="Par35">Any standard score compares the raw score of the individual to some reference group, and that comparison must be referenced when interpreting the score. When interpreting a patient&#x02019;s score, there are two questions to answer:</p><p id="Par36">The first question to answer is &#x0201c;how does this patient compare to other similar patients?&#x0201d; To the extent that a particular patient is atypical, normal treatment protocols may not apply. Further, knowledge of how a patient differs from a typical patient can inform treatment decisions and assist in the process of selecting patients for medical treatments. As a general psychometric principle, the closer the norm group to a patient&#x02019;s status and circumstances, the more relevant the resulting score (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, National Council on Measurement in Education, and Joint Committee on Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (U.S.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">A second question that is sometimes overlooked is &#x0201c;how does this patient compare to the average healthy person?&#x0201d; To assess the severity of a patient&#x02019;s psychological condition, or the degree to which a patient has been harmed&#x000a0;by an injury, a comparison to a healthy state is required. This is because the effect of a medical condition cannot be seen in a comparison to other medical patients, as all have been affected by a similar loss of health. For example, if a patient who has had a recent traumatic amputation reports an average level of PTSD compared to other patients with traumatic amputations, this average level of PTSD does not mean that no PTSD is present. Instead, it means that compared to other amputees, the level of PTSD is similar. If this same patient&#x02019;s PTSD score was compared to the average person in the community, however, it may be that the patient&#x02019;s level of distress now appears quite elevated. Overall, it can be seen that if the norm group is extreme, a patient with an extreme problem will appear normal relative to that group, but that is not the same as a state of health. This leads to the somewhat counterintuitive interpretive dilemma if a PTSD scale utilized a norm group consisting of extremely traumatized subjects, an average score would be positive for PTSD.</p><p id="Par38">A few tests used for the assessment of medical patients attempt to address the questions above by having multiple norm groups, notably the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD), and the BHI 2. However, these tests all address this matter in different ways, with different advantages and disadvantages. For forensic assessment, the MMPI-2-RF includes disability litigant norms and spinal surgery norms (Ben-Porath and Tellegen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>), while the MBMD utilizes both general medical and chronic pain norms (Millon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2010</xref>). The BHI 2's use of norm groups is somewhat different than these measures, however (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>), and is described below.</p><p id="Par39">As opposed to utilizing a highly specific norm group, the BHI 2 patient norm group utilizes a more diverse cross section of patients in treatment for pain or injury, consisting of an approximately equal number of patients with acute injuries and chronic pain. This group included spinal surgery patients, nonspinal surgery patients, interventional pain medicine patients, chronic pain patients, work hardening patients, acute pain patients, and brain injury patients, with 26&#x000a0;% being in litigation. These patients were obtained from 90 sites in 30 US states, recruiting patients from both facilities that treated chronic pain and that treated acute injuries. Patients were stratified to match US Census demographics (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>). This approach has broad applicability, because patients referred for spinal presurgical evaluations might have acute conditions, while patients referred prior to spinal cord stimulation are invariably suffering from chronic pain, and litigation is common in the workers&#x02019; compensation and personal injury systems. Overall, this approach produced a psychometrically representative but less extreme normative sample that represented an attempt to depict the average patient in treatment for pain or injury. The second BHI 2 norm group is the community norm group, which was also stratified to match US Census demographics (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par40">In addition to the two main normative groups, the BHI 2 also includes eight smaller, narrowly focused reference groups. These are chronic pain, head injury/headache, neck injury, upper extremity injury, low back injury, lower extremity injury, fake good, and fake bad. These additional more narrowly focused normative groups are integrated into the interpretive analysis and used to address specific questions if needed.</p><p id="Par41">The BHI 2 differs from other multi-norm tests in that as opposed to having the user choose between alternative norm groups, the BHI 2 patient and community norm groups are integrated into a single continuum. This is accomplished in the following manner, using pain as an example: Not surprisingly, the average patient in treatment for pain or injury reports more pain than does the average nonpatient in the community. Even so, there are some Pain Complaints scores on the BHI 2 that fall within the normal range for both the patient and community norm groups. These levels of pain are designated as &#x0201c;average scores.&#x0201d; As scores on the Pain Complaints scale increase, at some point, the level of pain reported will be unusual for a healthy person but still commonly seen in patients in treatment for pain. As the level of Pain Complaints increases further, at some point, it will also become an unusual level of pain reports for a patient as well.</p><p id="Par42">Conversely, with regard to interpreting low reports of pain, a patient may report less pain than does the average patient in treatment for pain or injury. As the Pain Complaints scores fall still lower, however, the level of pain will not only be below the typical patient in treatment, but also below that seen in the typical healthy person, which would be particularly unusual. Using this algorithm, the Pain Complaints scale integrates both community and patient norms into a single continuum (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The BHI 2 integrated norm profile is interpreted&#x000a0;as follows, utilizing the profile shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>:<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The interpretive continuum of BHI 2 scale scores using integrated patient and nonpatient norm groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12207_2014_9206_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

This will include a brief synopsis of the scales&#x02019; rationale and development process, validity research, and interpretive considerations. Except as otherwise noted, the information presented below was derived from the BHI 2 validation study (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>). An overview of each scale&#x02019;s reliability, and its correlates and bidirectional skew is summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Validity Scales and Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Validity Items</title><sec id="d32e1267"><title>Development</title><p id="Par52">The BHI 2 utilizes two separate validity conditions to determine whether or not a protocol can be meaningfully interpreted. The first condition has to do with bizarre responding, while the second has to do with failure to respond (i.e., leaving items blank). With regard to the first condition, the BHI 2 contains four Validity Items, which have extreme or bizarre content and are rarely endorsed. While a patient with a&#x000a0;thought disorder might endorse one or more of these items, an alternate interpretation is that the patient was responding in the aberrant direction on these items due to illiteracy, random responding, visual/cognitive problems, or poor motivation.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Scale Interpretation</title><p id="Par53">When a patient endorses one or more of the Validity Items, the item is printed out for the clinician to review along with a validity caution. If three or more of these items are endorsed, the entire BHI 2 is regarded as invalid due to bizarre responding. If this method determines that the BHI 2 administration is valid overall, the scales are next tested individually.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blank Responses</title><sec id="FPar3" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p id="Par54">The second validity condition occurs when a patient fails to respond to a number of items. Based on this method, the BHI 2 scales are invalidated one at a time. If any scale has 25&#x000a0;% or more of its items left blank, that scale is judged to be invalid and is not scored. This allows the BHI 2 to invalidate one scale at a time based on the blank item condition, rather than invalidate the entire test if one scale was left blank. The BHI 2 computer algorithms will generate an interpretive report of the information available if one or more scales are valid. This reduces the risk that a test administration will produce no usable results. If all 18 scales are invalid due to blank items, then the entire BHI 2 protocol is invalid. Note that if the patient is not in the workforce now or at the time of onset of the condition, the test instructs the patient to leave the Job Dissatisfaction scale blank. This scale is then designated as invalid, while the remainder of the BHI 2 scales are interpreted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Defensiveness</title><sec id="FPar4"><title>Development</title><p id="Par55">The Defensiveness scale was developed empirically to assess both positive and negative response distortions using the following method. Patients in treatment for pain and injury were recruited and asked to subtly fake the BHI 2 good or bad, being cautioned that if their faking was too obvious, they might be caught and they should try to avoid that. This method was used as research has shown that if patients think that they will be undergoing assessment for faking, they are able to feign deficits in a way that is both less exaggerated and more believable (Youngjohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">1999</xref>). Both groups of patients were then asked 475 questions, and items that were able to significantly differentiate both fake good and fake bad scenarios from patients were selected for the BHI 2 Defensiveness scale (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Scale Interpretation</title><p id="Par56">High scores suggest a positive bias (faking good), and low scores a negative bias (faking bad). This scale is highly bidirectional and negatively skewed. Patients who are low in Defensiveness are describing their life and circumstances as terrible, while patients who are high in Defensiveness describe their life and circumstances as great. In either case, however, the Defensiveness scale does not contain items pertaining to personally sensitive information, so neither high nor low scores involve much self-disclosure. In the validity section of the BHI 2 report, unusual Defensiveness scores are compared to the two faking reference groups, producing a subtle fake good percentile rank or a subtle fake bad percentile rank. This makes it possible for the examiner to better interpret any response bias in the patient&#x02019;s BHI 2 profile.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Validity Research</title><p id="Par57">At cross-validation, the Defensiveness scale was able to significantly differentiate subtle fake good versus patient groups and subtle fake bad versus patient groups significantly at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001. The Defensiveness scale correlated to &#x02212;.56 with the MCMI-III Debasement (Z) scale, and to &#x02212;.62 with the MMPI-2 Profile Elevation. Profile Elevation in turn is strongly associated with the MMPI 2 Disability Profile (Gatchel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2006</xref>). High and low scales here were able to identify those asked to subtly bias the information presented in positive and negative directions, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Self-Disclosure</title><sec id="FPar7"><title>Scale Development</title><p id="Par58">The Self-Disclosure scale was developed to assess how much a patient was willing to disclose about internal psychological distress. The Self-Disclosure scale was developed from a broad index of BHI 2 items pertaining to psychological distress and dysfunction, which excluded items about physical symptoms or social conflicts. It is conceptually similar to the MCMI-III Disclosure scale.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Scale Interpretation</title><p id="Par59">High scores indicate that the patient is disclosing an unusually high level of information about psychological dysfunction. In the clinical setting, patients with high Self-Disclosure scores are likely to be very open about conveying their internal psychological distress and dysfunction, sometimes to the point of self-debasement, and are often seeking help. Low scores suggest an unusual absence of any reported psychological difficulties. Patients with low levels of Self Disclosure are psychologically more guarded and private, may have concerns about who has access to the information that will be disclosed, and might not be motivated to share much personal information with the examiner.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Validity Research</title><p id="Par60">At cross-validation, the Self-Disclosure scale was able to significantly differentiate fake good versus patient groups and fake bad versus patient groups significantly at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001. The Self-Disclosure scale is correlated to .66 and .62 with the MCMI-III Disclosure (X) and Debasement (Z) scales, respectively, and to .69 with the MMPI-2 Dissimulation (F&#x02013;K) index, to .58 with the Infrequency (F), and to &#x02212;.57 with the Correction (K) scale. Very high BHI 2 Self Disclosure scores (indicating a very high level of reported psychological distress) have been identified as a possible indication of malingering (Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Physical Symptom Scales</title><p id="Par61">The BHI 2 is a biopsychosocial inventory that assesses physical, psychological, and social variables. On the BHI 2, the Pain Complaints, Somatic Complaints, Functional Complaints, and Muscular Bracing scales assess physical symptomatology. The BHI 2 test administration begins with the Pain Complaints scale, followed by the Somatic Complaints scale. Since the presenting concern of medical patients is their physical symptoms, this begins the test administration with the likely area of their primary concern. It was hoped that this would reduce patient resistance to completing the inventory.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pain Complaints</title><sec id="FPar10"><title>Development</title><p id="Par62">Pain is assessed in two primary ways in clinical settings: numerical rating scales and pain drawings. At the time of this writing, a Medline search for &#x0201c;VAS&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;NRS&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pain&#x0201d; yielded 13,664 articles, demonstrating that this approach to pain assessment is ubiquitous. In contrast to uni-dimensional ratings, scored pain drawing methods rely entirely or in part on the number of body sites with pain (Takata and Hirotani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">1995</xref>), and widespread pain predicts disability (Gerdle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2008</xref>; Grotle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2010</xref>; Kamaleri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2009</xref>; Overland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2012</xref>), inactivity (McBeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2010</xref>), complaints of nonmusculoskeletal medical problems (Kadam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2005</xref>), greater medical utilization (Kadam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2005</xref>), autonomic dysfunction (McBeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2007</xref>), occupational disability (Mayer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2008</xref>), Waddell signs (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1993</xref>), treatment outcome (Takata and Hirotani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">1995</xref>; Voorhies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2007</xref>), performance on isokinetic measures of strength and function (Ohnmeiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2000</xref>), and continuing chronic pain 12&#x000a0;years in the future (Andersson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). As pain has been identified by two systemic reviews as an important predictor of poor outcome from spinal surgery (Celestin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>; den Boer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2006</xref>), a principle goal of the BHI 2 was to develop a multidimensional assessment of pain. The BHI 2 utilizes a hybrid approach to assess both pain intensity like a VAS/NRS, and pain distribution like a pain drawing. To accomplish this, the BHI 2 Pain Complaints scale asks about pain intensity in ten different body areas, which provides a composite score.</p></sec><sec id="FPar11"><title>Interpretation</title><p id="Par63">High scores on the Pain Complaints scale indicate widespread pain in multiple body areas. This pattern of diffuse pain complaints can be observed in patients with diffuse rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain generally.

This approach mathematically compares the distribution of a patient&#x02019;s 10 pain reports on the BHI 2 to patients in various diagnostic categories, using a series of discriminant functions.

If a patient is injured while at work, having pain can allow a worker to escape from an undesirable job, receive pay while off of work, resume work with reduced duties, force the employer to make accommodations, receive opioid pain medication, receive desirable treatments, and if they fail to recover, receive monetary compensation for not getting better. Thus, when recovery means return to work, Job Dissatisfaction can be a significant predictor of poor outcome.

While the longer BHI 2 takes 30 to 35&#x000a0;min to administer, the BBHI 2 can be administered in about 10&#x000a0;min. The BBHI 2 is composed of six scales: Defensiveness, Pain Complaints, Somatic Complaints, Functional Complaints, Depression, and Anxiety. Of these, three (Defensiveness, Pain Complaints, and Functional Complaints) are identical to the scales on the longer BHI 2. The other three scales (Somatic Complaints, Depression, and Anxiety) are shortened versions of the longer BHI 2 scales, which intercorrelated very highly with the longer versions. The BBHI 2 Somatic Complaints scale correlates with the BHI 2 version to .96, the BBHI 2 Depression scale correlates with the BHI 2 version to .95, and the BBHI 2 Anxiety scale correlates with the BHI 2 version to .91.</p><p id="Par123">The BBHI 2 Somatic Complaints, Depression, and Anxiety scales are different from their longer BHI 2 counterparts in one important respect. In contrast to the longer scales on the BHI 2, which includes both transient &#x0201c;state&#x0201d; type items with more enduring &#x0201c;trait&#x0201d; type items, the shortened BBHI 2 scales focus on state items, as opposed to trait items. The rationale for this is that the BBHI 2 was intended to be useful in serial assessment, in order to track changes over the course of treatment. In order to do so, however, it was necessary to focus on state items (e.g., &#x0201c;I feel sad&#x0201d;) as opposed to trait items (e.g., &#x0201c;I attempted suicide in the past&#x0201d;). This is because state items are changeable, whereas trait items are not. By this focusing on state items, the BBHI 2 scales focused on changeable symptomatology, making them more sensitive to change in response to treatment.

To this end, the BHI 2 can be employed to produce scores for several different presurgical or pre-opioid treatment assessment protocols. These protocols were developed for various purposes by different methods, and each has their own unique strengths and weaknesses.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Presurgical Psychological Assessments</title><p id="Par126">From the standpoint of the strongest scientific evidence, the two presurgical protocols with the highest level of evidence are based on&#x000a0;the systematic reviews of psychosocial risk factors conducted by den Boer and colleagues (den Boer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2006</xref>), and by Celestin and colleagues (Celestin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>). These two studies produced very similar results and share two weaknesses. First of all, neither den Boer nor Celestin suggests any means of performing a presurgical assessment. Thus, while they are very informative theoretically, neither study made any suggestions about translating their findings into clinical practice.</p><p id="Par127">A second weakness of the&#x000a0;den Boer and Celestin studies can be understood by considering the conclusions of expert panels that made recommendations about presurgical psychosocial risk factors for spinal cord stimulators (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). This study reported a clinical consensus that the most important risk factors to identify were those having to do with severe psychopathology, such as being suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, and addicted. Unfortunately, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the outcome of back surgery on patients who are also suffering from any kind of severe psychopathology. As there are no such studies in the literature, the den Boer and Celestin studies had nothing to review, and they made no recommendations about severe psychopathology. Because of these limits to the research literature, if a patient was diagnosed with antisocial personality, cocaine addiction, paranoia, homicidality, had threatened the physician, and had a history of making fraudulent medical claims to obtain opioids, that patient would have no psychosocial risk factors using either the den Boer or Celestin protocols.</p><p id="Par128">In contrast to the den Boer and Celestin scientific studies, Block and colleagues (Block et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>; Block et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Epker and Block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2001</xref>) and Bruns and Disorbio (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>) developed clinically oriented protocols. These protocols for the most part subsume the den Boer and Celestin criteria, while adding more serious signs of psychopathology. In contrast to den Boer&#x02019;s and Celestin&#x02019;s approaches, Block&#x02019;s translational science&#x000a0;method integrates psychological testing and educational information for psychologists about the surgical procedures involved, along with an integrated clinical algorithm.</p><p id="Par129">Using a different methodology&#x000a0;than Block and colleagues, the Bruns and Disorbio review produced a two-tiered set of risk factors coupled with a clinical assessment method. The first tier was of moderate risk factors similar to Block&#x02019;s criteria in many respects, and like Block, it subsumed the den Boer and Celestin criteria. However, the Bruns and Disorbio study also identified a separate set of severe &#x0201c;exclusionary&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; risk factors, any one of which is widely held to be so behaviorally disruptive as to create grave concerns about a patient&#x02019;s ability to benefit from medical treatments (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). While there are no meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs of any of these primary risk factors, some empirical studies of these extreme risk factors have recently been published. These include studies pertaining to suicidal ideation (Fishbain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2012a</xref>; Fishbain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2012b</xref>), violent ideation (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>; Bruns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>), thoughts of killing a physician (Bruns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Fishbain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2009a</xref>), thoughts of suing a physician (Fishbain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2008</xref>), borderline personality (Tragesser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2010</xref>), medical entitlement (Fishbain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2014c</xref>), undefined medical symptoms (Fishbain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2010a</xref>), and others.</p><p id="Par130">Both the Block and the Bruns and Disorbio methods have the advantage of being integrated with assessment methods, making them practical for clinical use. For example, the two-tiered approach has been adopted by some evidence-based medicine guidelines for assessing patients with chronic pain (Colorado Division of Workers&#x02019; Compensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>), and research suggests that this integrated biopsychosocial protocol appears to deliver better care at a reduced cost (Bruns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012b</xref>). However, practical considerations aside, if the standards of evidence-based medicine are strictly applied, the den Boer and Celestin findings have reached a higher standard of evidence.</p><p id="Par131">An advantage of the BHI 2 is that since it was designed to assess the full range of relevant psychological variables, it is able to perform a standardized assessment of nearly all of the variables identified by den Boer/Celestin (Meyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2012b</xref>), Block (Disorbio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2012b</xref>), and Bruns and Disorbio protocols (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). Using the BHI 2, preliminary comparisons of several studies of presurgical psychological evaluation protocols have been published. These studies included the first evidence of the test-retest reliability of presurgical psychological evaluation protocols (Bruns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012a</xref>; Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). This information is especially important in forensic evaluations, as the <italic>Daubert</italic> standard of evidence requires that the level of error (i.e., reliability) of a method must be known. The results of these studies showed that using the BHI 2 to assess the den Boer/Celestin, Block, and Bruns and Disorbio protocols led to scores that were highly reliable, with test-retest reliability ranging from .81 to .95. Additionally, all of these presurgical protocols intercorrelated highly, ranging from .63 to .87. The fact that these four divergent methods led to the identification of similar criteria and that the scores intercorrelate strongly is an indication of convergent validity. However, while these four methods produce very similar scores and share half or more of their variance with each other, at the same time, they are all somewhat different. It should be noted that these reliability factors are based on a BHI 2 based assessment, and this would not be applicable to other methods of assessing these protocols.</p><p id="Par132">What can be said about which protocol to use? For a patient who is free of severe psychopathology, the den Boer/Celestin methods are supported by the highest level of evidence. However, these protocols identify only a core set of risk factors that have been well researched. For a more comprehensive assessment of psychopathology, the Block criteria or the Bruns and Disorbio criteria have advantages. The Block protocol has the advantage of having a defined method of clinical implementation, being the approach mostly closely associated with a clinical algorithm, having educational materials for psychologists about surgical procedures, and having a protocol that distills the information into a useful 1 to 5 rating tied to a clinical decision making tree. In contrast, the Bruns and Disorbio protocol differs here by having a somewhat more complex method, but one which generates a standardized score with 1 to 99 percentile ranks based on the BHI 2 norm groups. Suggested cutoffs are above the 84th percentile (1 standard deviation above the mean of patients) for moderate risk, above the 95th percentile for high risk, and above the 99th percentile for very high risk. The Bruns and Disorbio protocol has an important characteristic that it is the only presurgical protocol with evidence that it has no race or gender bias (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). It also has established test-retest reliability for the overall surgical risk estimate, and of all the protocols, it does more to define and identify severe psychopathology. Overall, there are several protocols for assessing psychosocial risk for poor outcome from surgery and other medical treatments, and the BHI 2 is able to provide estimates for all of them. This provides the examiner with the ability to use one test and then afterwards decide which protocol may be most applicable to a particular situation.</p><p id="Par133">Finally, it is&#x000a0;worth noting that there is evidence that the core set of psychosocial variables identified in these &#x0201c;presurgical&#x0201d; protocols may also predict the outcome of other medical treatment as well. For example, one study found that presurgical psychological risk factor assessment scores were associated not only with the perception of a good outcome in spinal surgery patients but also with the perception of a good outcome in nonspinal surgery patients, chronic patients, acute pain patients, work hardening patients, patient litigants, and brain injury patients (Bruns and Disorbio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). This suggests that these risk factors may apply not only to spinal surgery outcome but also to the outcome of medical treatments generally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Pre-opioid Treatment Evaluations</title><p id="Par134">In addition to presurgical psychological evaluations, there are other types of medical treatment where pretreatment psychological evaluations are indicated. One of these is a pretreatment psychological evaluation prior to initiating chronic opioid therapy. Aberrant use of opioids has been observed in up to 24&#x000a0;% of patients (Martell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2007</xref>), and the CDC has recently reported that more accidental overdose deaths involve opioid analgesics than heroin and cocaine combined (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>). Not surprisingly, 10 of 13 major opioid guidelines recommend psychological assessment prior to long-term opioid treatment (Nuckols et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par135">Studies suggest that physicians feel conflicted about treating chronic pain with opioids. Surveys of physician attitudes have found that physicians feel that chronic noncancer pain is undertreated, yet at the same time would not prescribe opioids for this condition (Morley-Forster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2003</xref>). This reluctance of physicians to prescribe opioids&#x000a0; is associated with two related concerns: opioid craving and opioid addiction. With regard to craving, animal studies have demonstrated that a biological property of opioid medications is that they induce craving (Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). In human studies, opioid craving has been shown to be associated with opioid relapse in patients who were in treatment for opioid abuse (Tsui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2014</xref>) and opioid craving is in turn influenced by both mood (Martel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2014a)</xref> and cognitions (Martel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2014b</xref>).</p><p id="Par136">A number of risk factors for opioid abuse have been identified in the literature, and almost all of them can be assessed using BHI 2 measures.

Additionally, social risk factors include tension at home (Akbik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Butler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Butler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>), conflict with the physician (Akbik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Butler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Butler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>), younger age (Edlund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>; Green et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2009</xref>), low education (Fitzcharles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2011</xref>), unemployment (Fitzcharles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2011</xref>), and a history of arrest (Akbik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Butler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Butler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). A recent study used BHI 2 variables representing the constructs above and used them to predict both the perceived need for pain medication and perceived addiction to pain medicine, identifying the need for medication correctly 73&#x000a0;% of the time, and addiction status correctly 86&#x000a0;% of the time (A. Bruns, Bruns, Disorbio, and Jewell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par137">Overall, while pre-opioid psychological assessment protocols are not as well developed as presurgical protocols, there is ample evidence of the value of these assessments. With regard to both presurgical and pretreatment evaluations though, the forensic evaluator should be aware that any of the psychological risk scores mentioned here should not be construed as defining the entire evaluation. While these risk scores are important considerations, they should be interpreted within the context of the patient&#x02019;s history, medical findings, degree of surgical necessity, and other relevant factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par138">The BHI 2 is a biopsychosocial assessment tool whose development was based on a theory of how biological, psychological, and social forces interact in patients with serious injury or illness. While the biopsychosocial model applies to individuals generally, the BHI 2 is especially attuned to the assessment of patients suffering from pain and injury. In the forensic setting, the BHI 2 can be useful in several ways. First of all, a BHI 2 assessment can enable the examiner to perform a biopsychosocial assessment of the patient, which can measure and describe various subjective phenomena, while controlling for patient bias of report. This can provide a deeper understanding of the contributors to the patient&#x02019;s pain and suffering, by identifying risk factors that appear to be pre-existing, ones that may be reasonably attributed to the onset of a particular medical condition, ones that are consistent with biologic reports, and ones that are difficult to explain biologically.</p><p id="Par139">Like all psychological inventories, the BHI 2 has both strengths and weaknesses. Its strengths include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par140">The BHI 2 is a standardized test and was developed based on a biopsychosocial paradigm that is especially well suited for assessing patients with injury, chronic pain, or other somatic symptom disorders.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par141">The BHI 2 has both community and patient normative groups, as well as eight other reference groups which can be used to make relevant comparisons to address a variety of clinical questions.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par142">The BHI 2 interpretive algorithms integrate community and patient norms into a single continuum, which prevents problems associated with conflicting findings.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par143">Consistent with current psychometric concepts, the BHI 2 and BBHI 2 utilize bidirectional scales.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par144">The BHI 2 has a short form, the BBHI 2, which can be administered in 10&#x000a0;min or less.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par145">The BHI 2 and BBHI 2 are the only instruments that include both a standardized multidimensional measure of pain and validity assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par146">The BHI 2 is the only test that can by itself assess all of the presurgical assessment criteria identified by the systematic reviews of den Boer and Celestin. It also has scales that directly or approximately measure the presurgical criteria identified by Block, and by Bruns and Disorbio (excluding determinations that require medical examination or chart review).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par147">The BHI 2 has a particular strength in assessing pain, reactions to injury, dysfunctional pain cognitions, and pain-related psychopathology, including somatization, affective distress, substance abuse, characterological traits, suicidality, violent tendencies, and litigious tendencies.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par148">The BHI 2 also has significant weaknesses. They are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par149">In comparison to the MMPI-2-RF, the BHI 2&#x02019;s validity assessment is not as comprehensive. Although the BHI 2 validity scales were developed through a sound clinical study&#x000a0;in a pain and injury population, the MMPI-2-RF has a larger number of validity scales that have been more extensively studied in a variety of populations. The MMPI-2-RF is also able to detect a wider range of psychiatric conditions&#x000a0;as this is the test's primary purpose, versus the BHI 2's focus on biopsychosocial assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par150">In comparison to the MBMD, the BHI 2 has more of a focus on pain and injury, but less ability to assess how a patient copes with the stress of disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par151">The independent peer&#x000a0;review by the Buros Institute noted above suggested that the greatest need for future BHI 2 research was for further studies on&#x000a0;malingering and longitudinal outcome&#x000a0;studies.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par152">While the validity of many of the BHI 2 scales have been supported by multiple research studies, others have more limited research support.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par153">While most of the BHI 2 scales are based on conventional constructs, such as depression and anxiety, others are based on novel constructs, such as symptom dependency, or perseverance. Further research is indicated on these novel scales.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par154">A weakness the BHI 2 shares with most inventories is that there have been no studies regarding the long-term reliability of its scales.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par155">As noted previously, the BHI 2 approach to assessing depression and anxiety has both strengths and weaknesses. By dividing the assessment of depression into two separate scales, Depression (thoughts and feelings associated with depression) and Vegetative Depression (physical symptoms associated with depression), the BHI 2 controls for false positive depressive findings due to reports of medical symptomatology resembling depression. However, the weakness with this approach is that the full scope of depressive symptomatology is thus spread across two scales, making the assessment of depression somewhat more complex. This approach thus represents a trade-off for the assessment of depression, and the same could be said for the BHI 2 approach to the assessment of anxiety.</p><p id="Par156">Overall, while the BHI 2 has some identified weaknesses, its numerous strengths pertaining to the assessment of patients with pain or injury will enable it to play a useful role in the forensic psychologist&#x02019;s toolbox.</p></list-item></list>
