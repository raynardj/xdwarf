The PiPS models are categorized as PiPS-A or PiPS B, depending on inclusion of blood test results. These models have shown an overall accuracy of 57.3% compared with actual survival. It has been shown that the median survival across the PiPS categories corresponds to the actual median survival. The PPI and the PaP have been validated in many countries, including Korea;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref> however, there have been no reports on the validation of the PiPS prediction models. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validation of the PiPS models in Korean advanced cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We evaluated advanced cancer patients who were admitted to the palliative care ward in Samsung Medical Center Cancer Hospital between November 1, 2011 and February 1, 2013. Of the 256 inpatients, 202 were included as subjects. Fifty patients lacking the records required for the PiPS models, and 4 patients who had undergone chemotherapy within the previous 1 month were excluded. Advanced cancers were defined as those that no longer responded to treatment and underwent progression.</p><p>On admission, clinicians recorded the PiPS prediction results, which were calculated using the PiPS prognosticator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pips.sgul.ac.uk">www.pips.sgul.ac.uk</ext-link>). Parameters of PiPS prediction model and mental test score in the model are listed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP1">Appendix 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP3">3</xref>. Survival prediction was stratified into the 'days' (0-13 days), 'weeks' (14-55 days), and 'months' (&#x0003e;55 days) groups. The PiPS-A model comprised diagnosis, symptoms, and general health. The patients' diagnoses, which included breast cancer, male genital organs, distant metastasis, liver metastasis, and bone metastasis, were recorded by reviewing medical records. Cognitive status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and global health status were assessed by clinicians during admission. Cognitive status was assessed by using the abbreviated mental test score<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref> comprising 10-item scales. If the mental test score was &#x0003e;3, the clinician recorded a score of 0, and if the mental test score was &#x02264;3, the clinician recorded a score of 1. An ECOG score of 0 indicated normal active performance without restriction, while an ECOG score of 4 indicated complete disability or confinement to a bed or a chair. The global health scores ranged from 1 to 7, score 1 indicating extremely poor health, and score 7 indicating normal health. Heart rate, anorexia, dyspnea, dysphagia, loss of weight in the previous month, and fatigue were assessed on admission.</p><p>The PiPS-B model comprised diagnosis, symptoms, general health, and blood test results, which included white blood cell, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, urea, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and C-reactive protein, taken within 4 days of admission. In addition, the clinicians' estimates were recorded in order to compare to the PiPS predictions.</p><p>Data on the patients' age, sex, cancer treatment history, oxygen therapy, delirium, family support status, religion, and laboratory test results of hemoglobin, total bilirubin, and sodium were retrieved from the medical records. The family support status was assessed by a social worker of the hospital.</p><p>Actual survival time in days was defined as the time elapsed from admission to death. Patients who survived at the time of analysis (April 26, 2013) were regarded as censored data. Repetitive admissions were regarded as distinct admissions.</p><p>This study was performed in accordance with the institutional review board of the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea (IRB 2013-03-043).</p><sec><title>1. Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PiPS-A and the PiPS-B models in the prediction of survival were calculated for each of the 3 groups ('days,' 'weeks,' and 'months' groups). We estimated the overall accuracy levels to compare the PiPS and clinician's predictions against actual survival.</p><p>The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare the survival between the 3 groups of the PiPS-A and the PiPS-B models; P-values were corrected by Bonferroni's method due to multiple comparisons. All statistical assessments were considered significant when P &#x0003c; 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) and SAS ver. 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>1.

Validation of Prognosis in Palliative Care Study</title><p>The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the PiPS-A and PiPS-B models were calculated for the 3 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). In the prediction of survival, the model PiPS-A showed a sensitivity of 48.4%, a specificity of 87.7%, a PPV of 64.6%, and an NPV of 35.4% for the 'days' group; a sensitivity of 59.2%, a specificity of 61.6%, a PPV of 61.6%, and an NPV of 38.4% for the 'weeks' group; a sensitivity of 37.1%, a specificity of 74.9%, a PPV of 23.6%, and an NPV of 76.4% for the 'months' group.</p><p>In the prediction of survival, the PiPS-B model showed a sensitivity of 64.1%, a specificity of 77.5%, a PPV of 56.9%, and an NPV of 43.1% for the 'days' group; a sensitivity of 44.7%, a specificity of 64.7%, a PPV of 56.8%, and an NPV of 43.2% for the 'weeks' group; a sensitivity of 37.1%, a specificity of 78.4%, a PPV of 26.5%, and an NPV of 73.5% for the 'months' group.</p><p>The overall accuracy between the PiPS-A prediction and actual survival was 52.0%.

However, there were no significant differences in actual survival between the 'weeks' and 'months' groups (PiPS-A, P = 0.183; PiPS-B, P = 0.114).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the 'days' and 'weeks' groups, the PiPS-A/PiPS-B predictions and clinicians' estimates were consistent with actual median survival. However, in the 'months' group, where the PiPS-A/PiPS-B predictions and clinicians' estimates were 14 to 55 days, 17.3% of the patients in our study were included in the 'months' group, compared to 40% of the patients in the original study.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> These differences in patient numbers might have affected the results among individual groups. In our study, the actual median survival of 25 days was shorter than the actual median survival of 34 days observed in the original study;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> this result indicates a relationship between median survival and the patient population. The patients enrolled in our study were inpatients at a cancer hospital, whereas patients included in the original study were enrolled in various palliative care services, including a hospice, a hospital support team, a home-based palliative care service, and a community team.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> The results of the present study are consistent with those of earlier studies which reported that the median survival of inpatients in a tertiary cancer hospital is relatively shorter than that of patients in various types of palliative care.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref> One plausible reason for the shorter survival times may be due to the delay in referral to a palliative care service, as patients and their family members may choose to receive aggressive anticancer treatment even at an advanced cancer stage.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22)</xref></p><p>The PiPS-B scores, which included laboratory results, predicted shorter than actual survival times. The PiPS-B prediction of survival was the most accurate in the 'days' group (35.6%), while clinicians' estimates were the least accurate in the 'days' group (15.8%). These results demonstrate that advanced cancer patients' laboratory results are abnormal due to acute symptoms and long course of the disease on admission. Previous studies have reported that clinicians overestimate survival times.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref> Clinicians cannot accurately predict the time point of death, as they are optimistic due to their acquaintance with patients.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref></p><p>The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of predictions of survival using the PiPS-A and the PiPS-B predictor models were variable. Using the PiPS-A and the PiPS-B scales, the 'weeks' and 'months' groups showed significantly prolonged survival than the 'days' group, as measured by the Kaplan-Meier method. Although there was no significant difference between the 'weeks' and 'months' groups, our results suggest that the PiPS predictor models were useful for predicting whether advanced cancer patients could survive for more than 14 days. The PiPS-A model, which comprises diagnosis, symptoms, and general health, is non-invasive and useful when laboratory results are unavailable. Although the PiPS-B model, which includes blood test results, can objectively predict patient's condition, it predicted shorter than actual survival times in our study. In cancer hospitals, these laboratory results may be influenced by the treatment to manage acute symptoms.</p><p>There have been no previous reports on the validation of the PiPS predictor models in literature; in contrast, the PPI model has been validated in many countries.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24)</xref> The PPI, which is based on performance status, oral intake, edema, dyspnea, and delirium provides predictions of survival of 3 weeks. In earlier studies, the sensitivity and specificity of the PPI model ranged from 56% to 90%, and 60% to 94%, respectively. The PPV and NPV of the PPI model ranged from 71% to 87%, and 52% to 90%, respectively. The specificity of PiPS in our study was similar to that of the PPI model in previous studies; however, the sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of the PiPS model were lower in our study.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref></p><p>With the exception of weight loss in the previous month, anorexia, dyspnea, dysphagia, fatigue, decreased cognitive function, and increased pulse rate occurred with greater frequency in the present study than in the original study.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> These results may have been influenced by the fact that our subjects are admitted to the palliative care ward in a cancer hospital to manage acute symptoms. The laboratory test results were superior in the original study than in our study.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> The findings of the present study indicate that early treatment may influence the results of blood tests taken within 4 days of admission.</p><p>The results of the present study are subject to some limitations. First, the generalizability of our results is limited because the present study included only inpatients in the palliative care ward of a cancer hospital, excluding outpatients and other patients from various care systems, including hospices, and home and community care systems. Further research remains to be conducted, in order to generalize the findings for advanced cancer patients in various settings. Second, it is difficult to accurately predict survival due to some fluctuations in symptoms and laboratory results after treatment. Most patients were admitted to our palliative care ward to manage acute symptoms, and we used the laboratory results obtained within 4 days of admission. Third, the 'months' group of the present study was smaller than that reported in the original study.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> Therefore, large-scale studies are needed for clinical practice. Fourth, clinicians' criteria for survival estimates vary due to ambiguity of validation standards in global health; consequently, objective validation tools need to be developed.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25)</xref> Furthermore, education on survival prediction is important to improve the accuracy of survival prediction; a previous study has shown that the accuracy of survival prediction improved after training.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26)</xref></p><p>Despite these limitations, the present study was the first to evaluate the PiPS model, and has provided a basis for applying the findings to Korean advanced cancer inpatients. The PiPS prediction models of survival were superior to clinician's estimates. The results of this study suggest that accurate prediction of survival may require comprehensive prognostic tools that which include clinicians' estimates. The PiPS predictor models are useful for predicting whether advanced cancer patients will survive for more than 14 days. Further studies on long-term survival prediction and comparisons of accuracy of several prognostic tools are needed to develop more relevant prognostic factors in order to contribute to palliative care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="APP1"><title>Appendix
