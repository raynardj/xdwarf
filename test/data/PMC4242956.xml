band during squat exercises, by assessing electromyographic activities of the gluteus
maximus and gluteus medius. [Subjects] In total, 17 healthy males were recruited.
[Methods] Participants performed squat exercises with and without shoulder flexion loaded
by a tubing band. Gluteal muscle activities during the downward and upward phases of the
squat exercises were recorded using a surface electromyography (EMG) system. The mean
electromyographic activities of the gluteal muscles during squat exercises with and
without loaded shoulder flexion were compared using the paired t-test. [Results]
Electromyographic activities of the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius were greater in
both the upward and downward phases of the squat with loaded shoulder flexion.
[Conclusions] The combination of squat and loaded shoulder flexion can be an effective
exercise for increasing gluteal muscle activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Squat exercise</kwd><kwd>Gluteus maximus</kwd><kwd>Gluteus medius</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gluteal muscle strengthening exercises are used frequently in prevention and rehabilitation

because the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius control hip motions in the frontal, sagittal
and transverse planes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Excessive hip
adduction and internal rotation during walking or going up and down stairs, caused by

leading to lower extremity injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the exercises for strengthening gluteal muscles, squat exercises are commonly
prescribed in clinical practice<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study reported the gluteal
muscles showed greater electromyographic activity during single-legged than in double-legged
squat exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, single-legged
squatting can cause inadequate alignment of the lower extremity, such as knee valgus<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, a modified method that facilitates
gluteal muscle activity during a double-legged squat exercise is needed.</p><p>It has been reported that loaded shoulder movements increase trunk muscle activity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Researchers have suggested that shoulder movements facilitate trunk
muscle activity to counteract the postural demands or reactive force caused by shoulder
movement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. From this point of view,
squat exercises with loaded shoulder movements may lead to greater electromyographic
activity in the gluteal muscles, as well as the trunk muscles, while maintaining appropriate
alignment of the lower extremity. However, no previously reported study has examined whether
loaded shoulder movement, in fact, facilitates gluteal muscle activity. Thus, the purpose of
the present study was to determine the effects of loaded shoulder flexion, using an elastic
tubing band, on gluteal muscle activity during a double-legged squat exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In total, 17 healthy males (mean age: 23.06&#x000b1;1.47&#x02005;years, mean height: 172.88&#x000b1;5.65&#x02005;cm, mean
weight: 68.29&#x000b1;4.69&#x02005;kg) were recruited for this study. Potential participants were excluded
if they had a history of neurological disease or surgery of the lower extremity. This study
was approved by the Inje University Institutional Research Review Committee. All
participants gave their written informed consent prior to participation in this study.</p><p>A Delsys surface EMG system (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA) was used to measure the
electromyographic activities of the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius of the dominant leg
during squat exercises. The sampling rate was 2,000&#x02005;Hz and data were bandpass filtered
between bandwidth 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. The EMG electrodes were attached on the landmarks of the
gluteus maximus and gluteus medius, according to Criswell<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. To normalize muscle activity, maximum voluntary isometric
contractions (MVICs) of the gluteal muscles were measured using the methods described by
Kendall et al<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.The MVICs of each muscle
were collected for 5&#x02005;s, and two trials were performed for each muscle separated by a 1-min
rest period. The mean value of the middle 3&#x02005;s of the two trials was used to calculate the
%MVIC of each muscle.</p><p>All participants performed squat exercises with and without loaded shoulder flexion while
maintaining a knee-over-foot position. The start position for all squat exercises was an
upright standing position with the feet shoulder-width apart. Participants were asked to
flex their knees until the tip of the patella reached a target bar (downward phase), and to
return to an upright standing position (upward phase) to perform the squat exercises. A
target bar was placed in front of the participants and adjusted so that the tip of the
patella reached the target bar when performing 60&#x000b0; of knee flexion. The downward and upward
phases of the squat exercises were performed for 3&#x02005;s, respectively, in time with the beat of
a metronome. For squat exercises with loaded shoulder flexion, a blue elastic tubing band
(Thera Band, Hygenic Corp., USA) was placed under the feet. Participants were instructed to
grip the tubing band at the level of the iliac crest to minimize differences in resistance
provided by the tubing band, and then performed 90&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion. The height of the
hand was maintained for a constant length of the tubing band during squat exercises with
loaded shoulder flexion. In the squat without loaded shoulder flexion, participants crossed
their arms over their chests and performed the squat exercises. All participants repeated
the squat exercise with and without loaded shoulder flexion three times.</p><p>The mean value of the gluteal muscle activity during the downward and upward phases of each
trial was calculated, and the mean value of three test trials under each condition was
expressed as %MVIC for data analysis. The EMG activities of the gluteus maximus and gluteus
medius between the two conditions were compared using the paired t-test. The PASW Statistics
software (ver. 18.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses.
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscle activities during the downward (p = 0.007 and p =

enhanced the electromyographic activity of the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius, compared
with general squat exercises. It has been reported that shoulder movements facilitate
contralateral muscle activity in response to postural demands<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, in the present
study, shoulder flexion may have induced an anterior displacement of the center of mass,
requiring greater the posterior muscle activity. Moreover, the gluteal muscles have an
important role in maintaining the neutral alignment of the lower extremity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; thus, loading shoulder flexion with the
elastic tubing band resulted in greater electromyographic activity in the gluteus maximus
and gluteus medius during the downward and upward phases of the squat in this study.</p><p>We used an elastic tubing band to provide resistance during the squat exercises. Such
tubing bands are less costly than other strengthening devices and easy to use. Furthermore,
the intensity of exercise can be adjusted, because the resistance provided changes with the
length of the tubing band<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, a
squat exercise using an elastic tubing band may be useful when the goal of the exercise is
to strengthen the gluteal muscles. In addition, the shortest length of elastic tubing band
that does not induce abnormal alignments of lower extremity may be the most appropriate for
providing the best resistance force for strengthening gluteal muscles of individuals during
squat exercises.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, only male subjects participated, so generalizing
the findings to other populations is problematic. Second, we did not collect kinematic data.
In a future study, we will determine whether the increased electromyographic activity of the
gluteal muscles due to the loaded shoulder flexion changed hip and/or knee kinematics during
the squat exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the 2014 Post-master Research Program of Inje University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nakagawa</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Muniz</surname><given-names>TB</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldon</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of additional strengthening of hip abductor and
