ability of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The thirty stroke patients who
participated in this experiment were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=15) or
control (n=15) group. The experimental group performed stair gait exercise for 30 minutes,
while the control group performed flat surface gait exercise for 30 minutes. The programs
lasted four weeks, with both groups performing the exercises three times per week for 30
minutes each time. The stability balance ability of subjects was measured and compared
before and after the interventions. [Results] The results of the experimental group showed
a significantly different values, but those of the control group did not. Between-group
comparison of changes in the anterior/posterior length in the limit of stability revealed
significant increases in the experimental group but no significant increase in the control
group. Only the surface area ellipse of Romberg, the length of Romberg, and length/area of
Romberg showed significant differences between the two groups after the interventions.
[Conclusion] The static balance ability improved in the group that performed the stair
gait exercise. This study provides important data for identifying the recovery of balance
ability through rehabilitation exercises in patients with nervous system diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Strokes</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd><kwd>Stair gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In hemiplegia patients, the lower extremity of the affected side supports only 25 to 43% of
the patient&#x02019;s body weight in standing postures, leading to asymmetric postures<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This reduces the ability of the body to
maintain its center of gravity and affects equilibrium reactions and orientation responses,
thereby seriously hampering postural control ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reduced balance ability induces flaccidity and spasticity in
the lower extremities of hemiplegia patients, and sensory function disorders of the affected
side hinder independent walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Poor
balance increases the risk of falls and serious complications in stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, preventing falls and enhancing the ability of stroke patients to perform daily living
activities independently is the most basic aim in stroke rehabilitation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stairs are used frequently in daily life, and differences between stair gaits and flat
surface gaits have been reported as follows: In stair gaits, each step starts from the toes
or the sole rather than the heel. Force is required to push the body upward and forward, and
control of the body against falls is required when descending stairs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. More dynamic effort is required in stair gaits than flat
surface gaits because an awareness of body balance and lower extremity force is
necessary<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with hemiplegia
resulting from lesions in the central nervous system perform flat surface gait exercise
first, followed by gait exercise on sloped areas and ascent and descent of stairs. These
exercises are indispensable not only for conducting activities of daily living but also for
self-reliance that enables the patients to be independent from others and should be
emphasized in the process of treatment without fail<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a review of stair gait-related studies, Eun et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that much larger extension moments than flexion moments
occurred in the lower extremity joints of healthy individuals and that larger extension
moments occurred in the knee and hip joints than in the ankle joints. Kim et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the contact force applied to knee
joints during flat surface gaits and during slope-way or stair gaits. They reported that the
contact force was greater during stair gaits, approximately 4.25 times that of the body
weight. Andracchi et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
the moments generated by the flexors and the extensors during ascent and descent of stairs
were much larger than those during flat surface gaits.</p><p>Improving balance is an important goal in the treatment of patients with hemiplegia caused
by stroke. Most studies of balance in stroke patients conducted thus far have examined
general gaits, and most studies on stairs have not included stroke patients. Thus, this
study examined the effects of stair exercise on the balance ability of stroke patients. The
results provide basic data on gaits useful for the treatment of individuals who have
suffered a stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was conducted at K Hospital located in Daegu from March 1, 2014, to March 30,
2014. The inclusion criteria were hemiplegia patients who had been diagnosed with stroke
by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at least six months
earlier, could maintain independent standing postures for at least 30 seconds, could walk
independently for at least 30&#x02005;m indoors, could communicate to the extent that they could

weeks. Before the experiment, all the subjects received general physical therapy
consisting of joint motion exercises, muscle strengthening exercises, and stretching
exercises from physical therapists with a clinical career of at least five years.</p><p>The experimental group performed gait exercise by ascending and descending wooden stairs,
which had a width of 0.8 m, high of 10&#x02005;cm, and tread depth of 28&#x02005;cm thread. In the gait
exercise program, the experimenter helped the patients to climb the stairs by holding the
ischium of the patients&#x02019; affected side, assisting the flexion of the popliteus, and
supporting the ankle when the ankle joint was unstable. While the patients descended the
stairs, the physical therapist supported the region above the patient&#x02019;s knee joint with
their left hand (in cases of left hemiplegia). The physical therapist also aided stability
by holding the patient&#x02019;s waist with his hands. When the patient&#x02019;s feet touched the stairs,
the forefoot came into contact with the stairs first to stably assist weight bearing by
the knee. The patients were allowed to hold a safety bar to prevent falls. Use of the
safety bar and the therapist&#x02019;s assistance gradually decreased as the patients&#x02019; gait
abilities improved<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The control group performed flat surface gait exercise by walking 10&#x02005;m back and forth on
a hard, stable indoor surface, which was free of obstacles. During the exercise, the
therapist watched the patients continuously to reduce the risk of falls.</p><p>A balance ability measuring and training system with biofeedback (AP1153 BioRescue,
France) was used to measure static balance ability of the subjects. The balance ability
measuring and training system is suitable for static and dynamic measurements of the
balance ability of patients, healthy individuals, and athletes. It records the moving path
line of the center of pressure during certain movements to determine the length (mm) of
the moving path line, the average speed (cm/s), and the area of the movements. The
patients were instructed to spread their legs to approximately 30&#x000b0; in an upright standing
posture and keep their eyes forward. Before the measurements, the method was explained and
demonstrated on a monitor. To measure the distribution of weight bearing between the
paretic and nonparetic sides and the total distance and area of movement of the center of
gravity of the body, the patients were instructed to maintain their balance and posture
for one minute while keeping their eyes forward. The patients were instructed by the
monitor on how to use ankle strategies to maintain their balance. To determine their
static balance, the limit of stability was measured in a static standing posture while the
patients maximally moved their center of gravity without losing their balance.</p><p>SPSS 17.0 for Windows was used for statistical processing of the data obtained in this
study, and paired t-tests were conducted to test the significance of differences before
and after the experiment in each group. The significance of between-group differences was
tested by conducting one-way ANOVAs and LSD ex post facto tests. The statistical
significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results regarding the ability of the patients to maintain balance during gait exercises
showed that the weight-bearing footprint on the paretic side of the experimental group
increased significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) and that of the nonparetic side decreased significantly
(p&#x0003c;0.05) after the experiment. In contrast, the weight-bearing footprint of the control
group did not decrease significantly on either the paretic or nonparetic side (p&#x0003e;0.05).
The anterior length in the limit of stability increased significantly on both the paretic
and nonparetic sides in the experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.05) but not in the control group
(p&#x0003e;0.05). Likewise, the posterior length in the limit of stability increased
significantly on both the paretic and nonparetic sides in the experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.05)
but not in the control group (p&#x0003e;0.05). Moreover, the surface area ellipse of Romberg
decreased significantly in the experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.05) but not in the control group
(p&#x0003e;0.05). With respect to the length of Romberg (p&#x0003c;0.05), it increased significantly
in the experimental group but not in the control group (p&#x0003e;0.05). The average speed of
Romberg decreased significantly in the experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group
showed no significant decrease (p&#x0003e;0.05). Although the length/area of Romberg decreased
significantly in the experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.05), it did not in the control group
(p&#x0003e;0.05). In the analysis of between-group differences before and after the experiment,
only the surface area ellipse of Romberg and the length/area of Romberg showed significant
differences (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>A comparison of balance between before and after the interventions for the CG and

of weight bearing and movements in stroke patients is the only means of obtaining
information on the recovery of balance ability in stroke patients. Such information has been
used to establish new treatment plans to increase the degree of weight bearing associated
with functional activities in stroke patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Efficient forms of gaits are indispensable for patients with
hemiplegia due to stroke to achieve functional independence in daily activities of
living<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One study of balance exercises for stroke patients indicated that the movements of the
upper/lower extremities decreased and postural shake increased in static standing postures
because the patients could not control their movements due to reduced muscle strength,
abnormal muscle tone, and abnormal movement patterns<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another reported that stroke patients&#x02019; body sways decreased
following the application of an ankle joint proprioceptive exercise program<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee compared the balance ability of an
experimental group with chronic stroke of at least six months who took part in traditional
physical therapy and task-based exercise programs and a control group who received only
traditional physical therapy<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study
reported that the body stability of the experimental group increased greatly. Declines in
balance ability in stroke patients lead to decreased gait velocity, placing additional
stress on patients and eventually making social functions more difficult<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In reviews of the correlation between the balance ability of stroke patients and their gait
ability, Keenan et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and Kim and
Lee<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that gait ability was
correlated with balance-related senses, and Bohannon and Leary<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that balance in standing postures was
significantly correlated with gait ability in many studies.</p><p>The findings of the abovementioned studies illustrate that the gait and balance abilities
of stroke patients are very closely related. Thus, only gait exercise performed in daily
living can have important effects on locomotion in stroke patient. Therefore, in this study,
the stroke patients were divided into a flat surface gait (control) group and a stair gait
group. The effects of the stair gait exercise on the following parameters were then studied:
static balance, changes in the weight-bearing footprint of the paretic and nonparetic sides
in static standing postures, the surface area ellipse of Romberg, the length of Romberg, the
average speed of Romberg, the length/area of Romberg, and the anterior/posterior length in
the limit of stability.</p><p>In this study, when the weight-bearing footprints in static standing postures were compared
before and after the experiment, they were significantly decreased on the nonparetic side
and significantly increased on the paretic side in the experimental group. In the case of
the surface area ellipse of Romberg and the length of Romberg in static standing postures,
the experimental group showed significant decreases, but the control group did not. With
regard to the length of Romberg and the average speed of Romberg, these decreased
significantly in the experimental group but not in the control group. Comparison of the
changes in the anterior/posterior length in the limit of stability in static standing
postures showed that they increased significantly in the experimental group but not in the
control group. In the tests for between-group differences before and after the experiment,
significant differences were observed only in the surface area ellipse of Romberg and the
length/area of Romberg.</p><p>The fact that the experimental group moved the distribution of weight bearing on the
paretic and nonparetic sides to the center of gravity for balance is likely due to the
patients moving their bodies as their weight moved from their nonparetic side to their
paretic side. They used ankle strategies in static standing postures until they achieved the
maximum degree of voluntary weight bearing. The former is like due to improvements in the
proprioceptive senses for the ankle joint or improvements in the ability to distribute their
body weight appropriately during the performance of gait motions. The increases in the
anterior/posterior length in the limit of stability of the stroke patients indicate that the
stair gait exercise improved the postural stability and balance ability of stroke
patients.</p><p>Eng et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that weight-bearing
ability in stroke patients was correlated with functional ability and that the ability of
stroke patients to asymmetrically move their body weight to the left/right in static
standing postures was closely related to motor functions and the level of independent
living, as well as the length of stay in the hospital. They further noted that gaits
directly affected the ability of the patient to transfer weight bearing forward, backward,
leftward, rightward from the paretic side in standing postures. Therefore, difficulties in
the control of postural balance not only cause asymmetrical standing postures but also lead
to postural sway, resulting in the repeated concentration of weight bearing on the
unaffected side and declines in postural balance ability<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in studies by Leroux et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and Lay et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, the activities of the gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, vastus
medialis, and gastrocnemius increased during slope-way ascents. Kim<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> compared electromyograms of stair gaits of patients with
hemiplegia due to stroke and found that the activities of the rectus femoris, biceps
femoris, and gastrocnemius were high when subjects were ascending a stairs. Therefore, stair
gait exercise appears to increase the activities of the muscles necessary for maintaining
postures to reduce diverse postural sway in static standing postures. This enables the
maintenance of standing postures by consuming a minimal amount of energy in these
postures.</p><p>In this study, the static balance of patients with hemiplegia due to stroke improved
significantly following stair gait exercise. The results of this study provide important
data for identifying the recovery of balance in stroke patients during rehabilitation
training. Continuous stair gait exercise can improve the balance functions not only of
stroke patients but also of patients with other nervous system diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>YR</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dual-task-related gait changes in individuals with
