test (CST) in healthy older Japanese people. [Methods] Relevant research articles for the
5-repetition chair stand test (CS-5) and the 30-second chair stand test (CS-30) were
identified by electronic database and manual searching. Research articles involving
healthy Japanese people aged 60&#x02005;years and older were included in a meta-analysis. Weighted
means of the CS-5 and CS-30 were estimated by the random effect model as the reference
values for the CST. Further, the effects of age and sex on the reference values were
analyzed by a meta-regression analysis. [Results] Seven articles (21 data) and three
articles (14 data) were included in the meta-analyses for the CS-5 and CS-30,
respectively. The reference value for the CS-5 was estimated as 8.50 sec [95% confidence
interval (CI): 7.93&#x02013;9.07]; age and sex were not associated with this reference value. The
reference value for the CS-30 was estimated as 17.26 times [95%CI: 15.98&#x02013;18.55], and age
was significantly associated with this value. [Conclusion] When the CS-5 and CS-30 are
used to evaluate elderly Japanese people, the reference values for the CS-5 and CS-30
determined in this study would be useful indices.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chair stand test</kwd><kwd>Meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>Older people</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The chair stand test (CST)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> is one of the physical performance tests for older people,

assess muscle strength around the knee joint in older people in the clinical setting without
a hand-held dynamometer. The CST has been demonstrated to be a simple and feasible physical
performance test, even for evaluating older people with limited mobility<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, prospective cohort studies
have demonstrated that the CST is a predictor of decreased activities of daily living (ADL)
and falls in older people<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study, a meta-analysis, reported a reference value as an assessment criterion
for the CST<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, the
results of the CST and the muscle strength around the knee joint have been reported to show
ethnic differences<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, the reference value<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported previously did not consider ethnic differences. The aim of
this study was to determine the reference values for the CST in healthy older Japanese
people by meta-analysis taking ethnicity into account.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Research articles published from January 1994 to September 2013 that reported data for the
CST were searched. For the CST, data including the CS-5<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and the CS-30<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>
were analyzed in the meta-analysis. The CS-5 is a task that involves standing up from a
chair 5 times as fast as possible, and the time that it takes to complete the task is
measured. On the other hand, the CS-30 is a task that involves repeatedly standing up from a
chair for 30 seconds as fast as possible, and the number of stand-ups completed during 30
seconds is counted.</p><p>Relevant research articles were sought from electronic databases: PubMed, Embase,
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Igaku Chuou Zasshi
(an electronic database that consists of medical research articles in Japan). Furthermore, a
manual search was also conducted from the indices of relevant scientific journals
(Geriatrics &#x00026; Gerontology International, Japanese Journal of Geriatrics, Japanese
Journal of Public Health). The terms &#x0201c;sit to stand&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;5-repetition Chair Stand test (CS-5)&#x0201d;,
&#x0201c;30-second Chair Stand test (CS-30)&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chair stand test&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chair rising test&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d;,
&#x0201c;older people&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;aged&#x0201d; were used in combination for the search.</p><p>The searches were limited to peer-reviewed research articles published in English or
Japanese. The retrieved articles were examined by three reviewers (TN, MA, NK) based on the
following inclusion criteria determined according to previous studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>: (1) the
articles involved Japanese people; (2) the articles involved community-dwelling people who
were aged 60&#x02005;years and older; (3) the articles involved older people with good functioning,
defined as those with independent ADL, independent instrumental ADL (IADL), and
participation in social activities; (4) the articles did not involve frail older people and
patients who had specific diseases, such as neuromuscular diseases and hip fractures; (5)
the sample size and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the CST were all described in
the text; and (6) information about the CST measurement method was described. The
functioning of subjects was judged by the same criteria as in previous studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The above inclusion criteria were adopted to minimize data variation
among the studies.</p><p>The articles fulfilling the above criteria were summarized to obtain the article
information (title, authors, and citation), information about the participants (age, sex,
and functioning), CST measurement method, sample size, and the mean and SD of the CST. All
information was tabulated and input into a computer database to perform further statistical
analysis (described below). When multiple CST values were reported in an article (e.g., data
reported by sex and age group), the data for each group were entered into the database.</p><p>Weighted means and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated from the data that
fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the analysis as reference values for the CST. Weighted
means were calculated by the DerSimonian-Laird method. Furthermore, the effects of age and
sex on the reference values for the CST were analyzed by a mixed effect model
(meta-regression analysis). Statistical analysis was performed using R programming language
and environment (R version 2.15.3)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and
the metaphor package for R (version 1.8-0)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The significance level was set at 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 1,169 articles were identified from electronic database and manual searching.
However, 1,060 articles that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria were excluded after
checking their titles and abstracts. Furthermore, 99 articles were excluded after checking
their full texts, as they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. Thus, 7 articles (21
groups)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and 3 articles (14

estimation of the reference values for the CS-5 and the CS-30, respectively. For the
measurement methods of the CS-5 and CS-30 in all articles fulfilling the criteria,
participants were instructed to sit in a chair with their feet fixed shoulder-width apart
and repeatedly stand up from the chair as fast as possible.</p><p>Studies with CS-5 data involved 6,050 subjects (men 494, women 1,659, unknown 3,897; mean

in ADL were determined using the methodology of meta-analysis in the present study. For the
CS-5, a reference value has been previously estimated<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, but ethnic differences in the CS-5 were not considered in that
study. When the reference values for the CS-5 estimated by the present study and previous
study<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> were compared, that for the CS-5
in the present study was 8.50 sec and that for the CS-5 in the previous study was 12.10 sec.
Thus, the reference value for the CS-5 in the present study tended to be shorter than that
in the previous study. The present finding is in agreement with the finding of a previous
report<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> that suggested ethnic
differences in the CS-5. This indicates that the reference value for the CS-5 estimated by
the present study appears to be specific and useful for older Japanese people. On the other
hand, no reference value for the CS-30 has been previously reported. The reference value for
the CS-30 found in the present study, also appears to be specific and useful for older
Japanese people.</p><p>The CS-5 was not significantly associated with age and sex in the present study. On the
other hand, a significant association was found between the CS-30 and age. Therefore, the
reference value for the CS-30 in healthy older people appears to decrease with age. A
previous study indicated that the CS-30 was significantly related to age, as in the present
study<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason why there is a
difference in the effect of age between the CS-5 and the CS-30 is not obvious from the data
and analysis in the present study. In conclusion, when the CS-30 is used as a physical
performance test in older people, age must be taken into account.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the sample size for estimation of the reference
value for the CS-30 was smaller than that for the CS-5. Therefore, the validity of the
reference value for the CS-30 may be relatively lower than that for the CS-5. Second, height
has been shown to affect the CST result<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the effect of height on the reference values for the CS-5
and CS-30 could not be clarified in the present study, since the height data were
insufficient for reliable analysis.</p><p>In this study, the reference values for the CS-5 and the CS-30, variations of the CST, were
determined for healthy older Japanese people. The CST can be measured using just a chair and
a stop watch. Therefore, the CST is a simple and feasible physical performance test for
older people and rehabilitation patients in the clinical setting<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the CS-5 and CS-30 are used to evaluate older
Japanese people, the reference values for the CS-5 and CS-30 estimated in this study would
be useful indices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and
