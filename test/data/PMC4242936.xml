on physical function and the amount of activity in home care patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease (PD). [Subjects and Methods] A 2-month home exercise intervention consisting of
self-administered exercise by patients (self-exercise) and home visit exercise therapy
guided by a physical therapist (home visit exercise) was conducted in 10 home care
patients with PD to compare changes in physical function, activities of daily living, and
postural status between before and after the intervention. [Results] A decreased number of
chief complaints and alleviation of fear of falling were observed after the intervention.
In terms of physical function, a significant increase in flexibility and muscle strength
were observed, although no significant changes were found in activities of daily living,
gait, and balance. Although there was no significant change in the total amount of daily
physical activity, the analysis of daily posture changes revealed a significant reduction
in the percentage of time spent lying down and a significant increase in the percentage of
time spent sitting after the intervention. [Conclusion] Guidance in home exercise in home
care patients with PD can be effective in making self-exercise a habit, improving range of
motion and muscle strength, and reducing the time spent in a supine position.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Home care patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the extrapyramidal system. A
curative therapy has not been established for PD, and a combination of drug therapy,
surgical treatment, and physical therapy is recognized as the standard treatment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The estimated incidence of PD in Japan is 50 per 100,000 in the overall population and 200
per 100,000 in the population aged 64 or older<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of patients with PD is expected to additionally increase
with the aging of the population in the future<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rates of discharge to home in patients with PD are high despite
heavy dependence on medical treatment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and 85.4% of all patients are under care at home<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, any support system or intervention to maintain
physical function in home care patients is important. In Japan, the nursing care insurance
service seems to play a major role under the current social security system in regard to
health insurance and nursing care insurance. One survey of outpatients with PD revealed that
75% of PD have been certified as being in need of care, and that the use of ambulatory care
and ambulatory rehabilitation services by PD patients has increased by 38% and 23%,
respectively, compared with a survey conducted 8&#x02005;years previously<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of users of nursing care insurance is also
increasing, although the service contents do not satisfy their needs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; tailored intervention is necessary because of great
variations in symptoms and severity among patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, in our study of exercise
therapy in home care patients with PD<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, we
found that a demand existed for intervention tailored to symptoms and their severity,
because the rehabilitation service provided by nursing care insurance is centered on group
exercise and exercise therapy using machines.</p><p>Intervention by guidance or by personal or group exercise therapy in patients with PD has
been reported in several studies to improve activities of daily living (ADLs)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, increase exercise capacity and improve
gait<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, extend range of motion<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and improve balance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few reports are available on the effectiveness of home
visit guidance on home exercise performed voluntarily by home care patients with PD. In
addition, it is not known how interventions in which home visit guidance is provided affect
aspects of daily living in home care patients with PD, a disease that is characterized by
daily fluctuations such as the on-off phenomenon and wearing-off phenomenon.</p><p>Our aim was to clarify the effect of home exercise consisting of daily self-administered
exercise by patients (self-exercise) and weekly home visit exercise therapy guided by a
physical therapist (home visit exercise) on physical function, ADLs, and postural status in
home care patients with PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This cohort study design was based on the performance of a 2-month home exercise
intervention in home care patients with PD and a comparison of physical function and
physical activity between before and after the intervention. Fourteen home care patients
with PD who belonged to the Miyagi Branch of the Japan Parkinson Disease Association
participated in the study. The inclusion criteria for the PD group were as follows: patients
with no change in antiparkinsonian drugs for &#x02265;2 months who were in stage II or III of the
Hoehn and Yahr severity scale and were capable of independent locomotion and participation
in the intervention program. The study was divided into three periods to take account of
seasonal affects on conditions: the first period was from January to February and included
two patients, the second was from February to March and included seven patients, and the
third was from May to June and included five patients. One patient in the second period and
three patients in the third period withdrew from the study because of hospitalization during
the intervention period, difficulty in conducting the home exercise because of aggravation
of low back pain, or other reasons; a total of four patients were thus excluded from the
study. Accordingly, the final analysis set included 10 patients (two male and eight female
patients). In the PD group, the mean duration of disease was 12.6&#x02005;years (SD, 5.6) and the
mean number of oral antiparkinsonian drugs being taken was 3.9 (SD, 1.2).</p><p>The home exercise consisted of daily self-exercise by patients and weekly home visit
exercise guided by a physical therapist (the first author); the intervention period was 2
months. Self-exercise was composed of the following five types of exercises: 1. stretching;
2. balancing in a four-points-kneeling position, with muscle strengthening; and 3. postural
change movements from sitting for a long time to a four-points-kneeling position. At the
beginning of the intervention, the physical therapist (the first author) provided guidance
on practice of self-exercise in the form of a self-made booklet with photographs, and the
patients were challenged to perform self-exercise at least three a week. We asked the
patients to keep a record of their daily training and falls on a calendar to confirm that
they had done the exercise and monitor any falling events during the intervention period. In
order to improve the motivation for self-exercise, guidance of self-exercise by the physical
therapist was provided to the patients during a visit in the presence of their family. In
addition, the status of implementation of self-exercise was checked weekly. The home visit
exercise consisted of 30&#x02005;min of exercise including 1. active-assistive and passive
stretching, 2. strengthening of the extensor muscles in a prone position, 3. movement from a
sitting to a standing position, 4. balancing in a standing position, and 5. stepping in a
standing position. The physical therapist (the first author) visited patients weekly to
conduct the home visit exercise. Patients performed self-exercise with no fixed schedule,
and the home visit exercise was conducted 1 to 2&#x02005;h after treatment with antiparkinsonian
drugs.</p><p>Home exercise was conducted with the approval of the physician attending each patient. The
study was planned in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was conducted with the
approval of the Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki
University. Prior written informed consent was obtained from the patients, and an encoding
process was used during the analyses to avoid identifying individuals.</p><p>An interview and assessment of physical function and physical activity were conducted
before and after the intervention. The assessment of physical function was always conducted
1 to 2&#x02005;h after treatment with antiparkinsonian drugs.</p><p>We interviewed patients regarding basic issues, including current medical history and
medications, and the following items:</p><p>Implementation of self-exercise: Before the intervention, we interviewed patients regarding
their self-exercise habits and the average number of times they had exercised during the
week preceding the study. After the intervention, the number of self-exercise sessions and
the daily average duration of self-exercise (in&#x02005;min) were calculated from the written
records of the patients.</p><p>Chief complaints regarding aspects of daily living: The number of chief complaints
regarding 37 aspects of daily living in relation to the symptoms and signs of PD, ADLs, and
instrumental ADLs (IADLs; see below) was surveyed in a multiple-answer manner, in accordance
with previous studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Falls: Patients were asked to state the number of times they had fallen in the past month
and to assess their fear of falling during that time. The Modified Falls Efficacy Scale
(MFES; scores) developed by Hill et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
was used to measure fear of falling. The MFES scores 14 activities on a 0 (not confident) to
10 (completely confident) scale. The maximum total score is 140 points, and higher scores
indicate greater self-efficacy in falling incidents.</p><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale (PDRS): The PDRS is a scale developed by Webster<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> that is used to score the severity of
symptoms in patients with PD. It consists of 10 items, including rigidity, postural
regulation impairment, tremor, and self-care activities. Each item is scored on a scale of 0
to 3. The maximum total score is 30 points, and a higher score indicates a greater level of
severity.</p><p>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs): The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of
Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG Index of Competence<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>) was used as an indicator of the performance of IADLs, which are
non-fundamental ADLs, such as shopping, laundering, telephoning, and medication management,
that enable an individual to live independently in the community. The maximum total score
for this assessment is 13 points.</p><p>The following seven items were selected as indicators of physical function:</p><p>Range of motion: The ranges of motion of shoulder flexion, trunk extension, and trunk
rotation (shoulder flexion angle, trunk extension angle, and trunk rotation angle,
respectively, in degrees) were measured according to criteria established by the Japanese
Orthopedic Association and the Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine.</p><p>Muscle strength: The isometric maximum muscle strengths of the hip flexors and knee
extensors were measured with a handheld dynamometer (&#x003bc;Tas F-1; Anima Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan); a sensor of the handheld dynamometer was held in the hand to impose manual
resistance in accordance with the posture required for measurement in Daniel&#x02019;s &#x00026;
Worthington&#x02019;s Muscle Testing (Hislop<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>).
Measurements were taken three times, including practice runs, and the maximum value (N) was
used in the analysis. Because no statistical difference between the sides of the body was
observed in the results, measurements from the dominant leg (the right foot in all patients)
were used as representative values.</p><p>Activities of daily living (ADLs): The Functional Independence Measure<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> (FIM) was used as an indicator of the ability to perform
basic ADLs such as feeding, going to the toilet, putting on clothes, grooming, and bathing.
The FIM consists of 13 physical items and five cognitive items, totaling 18 items. The
maximum total score for the assessment is 126 points.</p><p>Gait: The time and number of steps required to walk 5&#x02005;m at an optimum speed were measured,
and the walking speed (m/min) and cadence (steps/min) were calculated. Patients walked in
the principal walking style normally they used at home (with or without a cane). All
patients could walk without a cane.</p><p>Timed Up and Go (TUG) test: In the TUG test, the time required for an individual to stand
up from a seated position in a chair, walk toward a mark 3&#x02005;m ahead at their optimum walking
speed, make either a clockwise or counterclockwise turn around the mark, walk back at their
optimum walking speed, and sit down was measured twice, and the mean value was used in the
analysis.</p><p>Functional Reach Test (FRT): With the patient standing in a comfortable position with the
legs spread approximately shoulder-width apart and with the shoulder on the side of the
dominant arm flexed 90 degrees and the elbow joint completely extended, the distance moved
by the third metacarpal bone from its original position to when the individual reached
forward as far as possible was measured twice, and the mean value was used in the
analysis.</p><p>Functional Balance Scale (FBS): For the FBS, the Berg Balance Scale<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, a 14-item scale with a total score of 56 points, was used
for assessment. In addition, a 20-cm stool was used to test movement requiring a foot to be
placed on a stool. The assessment was conducted in the order of movements listed on the test
sheet.</p><p>As indicators of daily physical activity status, we measured the amount of physical
activity on the basis of the movements of a site near the center of the body. We also
recorded the changes in postural state, including the percentages of time spent per 24&#x02005;h
lying down, sitting, standing, and walking and the number of postural changes.</p><p>A high-capacity triaxial accelerometer (MVP-A3-05A-SD; MicroStone Corporation, Nagano,
Japan), which had the capacity to record continuously for up to 30 h, was used to measure
the amount of physical activity. The accelerometer was set with a sampling time of 200&#x02005;ms
and a low-pass filter of 35&#x02005;Hz. Considering the impact of rhythmic segmentation of the head,
limbs, and other body parts, the device was placed at the middle of the abdomen near the
center of the body to quantitatively assess movement ability in terms of full body motion.
According to the methods proposed by Iwashita<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, the resultant acceleration was calculated from the left-right (x
axis), front-back (y axis), and up-down (z axis) acceleration. Furthermore, the sum of all
impulse values for a 24-h period was obtained through integration with respect to time
(total impulse,&#x02005;kg m/h) and used as an indicator of the amount of physical activity.</p><p>A behavior recorder (A-MES; Solid Brains Co., Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan) consisting of two
3-dimensional position and acceleration sensors (sampling time: 200&#x02005;ms) attached to the
chest and thigh was used to measure the percentages of time spent per 24&#x02005;h in the four
movements of lying down, sitting, standing, and walking and the numbers of postural changes.
In addition, the time spent lying down was further categorized into the percentages of time
spent per 24&#x02005;h in a supine, side-lying, or prone position. The high-capacity triaxial
accelerometer and behavior recorder were attached together to give measurements for 24&#x02005;h for
2 consecutive weekdays, when average levels of activity were expected.</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 18.0 for Windows. The Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used to compare data from before and after the intervention, and the statistical
significance level was set at 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 10 study patients, four had been engaged in self-exercise before the intervention;

exercises were stretching and walking. significant increases in the number and duration of
self-exercise sessions per week were observed after the intervention compared with before.
It seemed that this was due to the effects of guidance in self-exercise and of management of
its implementation by using a self-exercise record book. These results are the same as those
reported by montgomery et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, who
found an increase in the number of exercise hours after the provision of daily living and
exercise guidance. In addition, our data on the number and duration of self-exercises before
the intervention highlight a problem: the duration of self-exercise each day in home care
patients with pd is insufficient, even if they are in the habit of performing self-exercise;
patients may not have the chance to exercise, except when they use ambulatory services.</p><p>Meanwhile, the number and duration of self-exercise sessions were increased by the
intervention. Accordingly, it seems that guidance and management to promote habitual
self-exercise in home care patients with PD are effective and are needed.</p><p>In the interview surveys, no marked changes were observed between before and after the
intervention in terms of the number of falls, the PDRS, or the TMIG Index of Competence. In
other words, the intervention seemed less effective at treating the number of falls in the
month before the survey, less effective at reducing the severity symptoms of PD, or the
performance of IADLs. However, a decrease in the number of falls<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> in the absence of improvement in primary functional
impairment<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> in response to exercise therapy has also been reported. In this
respect, further discussion of the content and duration of our home exercise intervention is
needed. In contrast, the number of chief complaints and the MFES scores were significantly
improved. In the chief complaint survey, patients were interviewed about how many items were
true of their PD symptoms and made their ADL difficult; the numbers of items decreased after
the intervention. It seemed that this was because the patients&#x02019; awareness of the effects of
guidance on exercise led to subjective changes<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the improved MFES scores showed that fear of falling
was alleviated. This appeared to result from the patients&#x02019; increased awareness of the
effectiveness of exercise guidance<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> and
from the improvement in fall risk scores because of the exercise intervention<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the physical function testing, shoulder flexion angle, trunk extension angle, hip
flexion muscle strength, and knee extensor muscle strength significantly increased after the
intervention. This is likely because the intervention improved flexibility and muscle
strength<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The trunk rotation angles in
our patients were close to the normal reference range of motion, even before the
intervention. This is apparently the reason why no significant difference in this parameter
was observed between before and after the intervention.</p><p>In relation to ADL, gait, and balance, no significant difference was observed between
before and after the intervention in FIM, an indicator of ADL. Some previous studies have
found an improvement in ADL after an intervention consisting of exercise therapy<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas others have reported otherwise<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Opinions are thus not unified. The following factors were
considered to be the reasons why the results of this study showed no significant differences
in FIM before and after the intervention: most of the study patients performed ADL
independently; the intervention period of two months was too short and insufficient; and the
program of the intervention focused on stretching, muscle strengthening, and postural
change. Further study will be required for the reference. Interventional effects using
treadmills or external cues such as visual and auditory stimulation during gait<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> have been reported. However, it seems that
we observed no significant differences in these parameters because neither a treadmill nor
external cues were used concurrently in the self-exercise and home visit exercises.
Moreover, our patients had relatively good walking ability and could walk at an optimum
speed of 50 m/min. The TUG, FRT, and FBS reflect walking ability<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because no change was observed in the indicators of
walking ability between before and after the intervention, no significant changes were
apparent in the TUG, FRT, or FBS either.In the tests of physical activity status,
significant differences between before and after the intervention were found only in the
percentages of time spent sitting and lying down. No significant change was observed in
total impulse as an indicator of the amount of physical activity or in the number of
postural changes. The significant decrease in the percentage of time spent lying down and
the increase in the percentage of time spent sitting were likely a result of the guidance in
self-exercise and the home visit exercise. The decreased time spent lying down is
particularly suggestive of the effectiveness of the intervention in improving physical
activity status. Because PD patients have reduced opportunities for walking owing to their
increased risk of falling<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>, these
patients are prone to sedentary living<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and their decreased activity can contribute to disuse syndrome<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, because many patients with PD experience
difficulty in rolling over with progression of the disease<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, bed rest in a supine position tends to be prolonged. Our
intervention of personal guidance in exercise therapy and self-exercise attempted to solve
these problems. However, significant improvements in amount of activity or the number of
postural changes were not obtained.</p><p>Our study focused on the average daily physical activity status of home care patients with
PD. However, our consideration of the patient&#x02019;s family and the social environment, which can
influence activity status, was not sufficient and is a limitation on our study. Furthermore,
the individual attention we provided was inadequate as guidance on exercise therapy was
conducted only once a week by a single physical therapist; this is another limitation of our
study. In addition to these points, tasks such increasing the number of patients to enable
us to consider disease severity in our investigation, as well as introducing exercise
guidance strategies proposed in previous studies and collaborating with other health
professionals, should be considered in a future study.</p><p>A 2-month home exercise intervention consisting of self-exercises and home visit exercises
was conducted in home care patients with PD. Physical function, ADL, and posture status
change were used as indicators. The intervention had favorable effects on self-exercise
frequency and duration and on self-recognition in terms of a reduction in the number of
chief complaints due to PD symptoms and a reduction in fear of falling. Furthermore, the
intervention was effective in improving flexibility and muscle strength and decreasing bed
rest time. However, the intervention did not increase the amount of activity or the number
of postural changes and thus did not reduce the overall sedentary nature of the patients&#x02019;
lifestyles. Further improvement of the intervention method, for example by adding group
exercise therapy or collaborating with other health professionals, will be needed to achieve
improvements in physical function and activity that reflect improvements in daily
living.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the participants for their contribution to this study. This work was
