axilla during single-crutch walking through kinematic analysis of the crutch position in
the horizontal plane. [Subjects] The subjects were 19 healthy young males. [Methods] The

crutch stance (crutch contact, mid stance and crutch off) for each subject. [Results] A
statistically significant effect of time was found in 17 of the 19 subjects. Sixteen of

[Conclusion] External rotation of the crutch throughout the stance phase is important to
enable the axillary pad to be held tightly against the chest wall. These results may lead
to alterations of the instructions for crutch use and the prevention of falls.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Crutch walking</kwd><kwd>Crutch position</kwd><kwd>Stability of the axillary pad</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The axillary crutch is an assistive device used by individuals with gait disturbance due to
lower-limb impairments such as fractures or surgery of the hip or knee joint. During crutch
walking, users have to hold the axillary pad firmly against their chest wall with their arm
and maintain their wrist in a dorsiflexed position on the handgrip to support their
weight<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, if the axillary pad is not held firmly to the chest wall,
it can separate from the axilla and this may lead to a fall. In the clinical experience of
the first and second authors, the axillary pad often deviates from the axilla during the
crutch stance phase crutch training. Sasaki et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that crutch use was dangerous when the shoulder joint was
placed in an internally rotated position (IRP), because the axillary pad is not fixed to the
chest wall and could easily slide backward from the axilla. They suggested that a
horizontally positioned shoulder joint was important to ensure that the axillary pad was
securely positioned against the chest wall.</p><p>The position of shoulder joint in the horizontal plane determines the position of the
crutch in the horizontal plane during crutch walking. Though supination or pronation of the
forearm and radial or ulnar deviation of the wrist influence the position of the crutch, the
position of the shoulder joint has the greatest influence<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized
that the position in the horizontal plane of the axillary pad could be used to estimate the
stability of the axillary pad during crutch walking.</p><p>The aim of this study was to estimate the stability of the axillary pad in the axilla
during single-crutch walking using kinematic analysis of the crutch position in the
horizontal plane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 19 healthy young males (mean age, 22.2 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x02005;years; mean height, 171.4 &#x000b1;
5.5&#x02005;cm; mean weight; 67.4 &#x000b1; 8.2&#x02005;kg). This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyushu
University of Nursing and Social Welfare. All subjects received a description of this study
and provided their written informed consent before participating in the study. Before
measurements were made, all subjects were provided with a crutch of an appropriate length
and practiced using the crutch. The appropriate crutch length was determined using the
standard method described by Rusk and Lowman<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Single-crutch walking was performed with a
pseudo-affected left leg and an unaffected right leg. Subjects were instructed to put 30% of
their body weight on the crutch<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, which substituted for the left leg, and performed two-point gait
by swinging the unaffected side out in front of the crutch.</p><p>The experimental set-up consisted of a Vicon MX13 three-dimensional motion capture system
(Vicon Peak, UK), comprising eight infrared cameras, six force plates (AMTI, USA) and a
digital video camera (Victor, JVC, Japan). The sampling rates of the motion capture system
and the force plates were 100&#x02005;Hz. Two infrared reflective markers were placed on an
extension that was attached to the axillary pad so that a straight line connecting the two
markers indicated the long axis of the axillary pad. Subjects were instructed to walk 5&#x02005;m in
a straight line using the single crutch, and this was repeated 10 times. Walking speed and
step length were determined by the subject.</p><p>The position of the crutch in the horizontal plane was defined as the angle between the
sagittal (Y-Z) plane and the long axis of the axillary pad, and it was calculated using data
collected by the motion capture system. The value of the angle was negative when the crutch
turned toward the body (internal rotation) and positive when the crutch turned away from the
body (external rotation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Definition of crutch angle. (1) Indicates internal rotation and (2) indicates
external rotation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1753-g001"/></fig>). The stance phase of the crutch during walking was identified from the ground
reaction force data. Crutch contact was defined as the point at which the crutch tip was
grounded on the floor, mid stance was defined as the point at which the anterior-posterior
ground reaction force had a value of zero, and crutch off was defined as the point at which
the crutch tip was taken off the floor.</p><p>Repeated-measures analysis of variance and the Tukey&#x02019;s honest significance test were used
to compare the crutch position across the three phases of stance for each subject. All data
were analyzed using standard statistics software (IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 19.0). p values
of less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>

The

honest significance test) for 15 out of the 17 subjects in the following three comparisons:
(1) crutch contact vs. mid stance, (2) crutch contact vs. crutch off, and (3) mid stance vs.
crutch off. As for the remaining two subjects, one subject showed statistically significant
differences for: (1) crutch contact vs. mid stance, and (2) crutch contact vs. crutch off;
and the other subject showed a statistically significant difference for: (3) mid stance vs.
crutch off.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Many diverse studies of crutch walking have been performed by researchers. For example, the
study of appropriate crutch length<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, the study of energy cost<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the study of crutch palsy or fracture<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
kinematic or kinetic study of the upper and lower extremities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, we were not able to find a study on the stability of the
axillary pad in the axilla. We hypothesized that the stability of the axillary pad in the
axilla is one of the main issues for safe crutch walking. Our study is the first attempt
using kinematic analysis of the crutch position to examine the stability of the axillary pad
during crutch walking.</p><p>We found that although there was inter-subject variation in the value of the angle, the
crutch externally rotated in the horizontal plane during the crutch stance phase for 16
subjects. For the remaining three subjects, the crutch rotated internally or did not rotate
during the crutch stance phase.</p><p>The external rotation of the crutch that was observed for 16 subjects, likely occurred
because of the shape of the chest wall, the position of the shoulder joint, and the fact
that the axillary pad was held firmly against the chest wall. Normally, the axillary pad is
held to the chest wall by the shoulder adductor muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the shape of the chest wall is assumed to be a plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Relation between the shape of the chest wall and the position of the shoulder joint
in the horizontal plane Grey rectangles indicate the crutch, open circles indicate the
arm, dotted arrows indicate the direction of the force of shoulder adductors, and
black arrows indicate the position of the shoulder joint.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1753-g002"/></fig>), the shoulder joint needs to move in flexion and extension in addition to adduction
during crutch walking to hold the axillary pad stably against the chest wall. If this were
the case, the shoulder joint and the axillary pad would not rotate. However, because the
chest wall has a rounded shape, the axillary pad moves along the chest wall, and the
shoulder joint and the axillary pad rotate to hold the axillary pad stably against the chest
wall. That is to say, internal rotation occurs when the shoulder joint flexes and external
rotation occurs when shoulder joint extends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2b</xref>). We propose that the rotation of the shoulder joint and the axillary pad is
very important for holding the axillary pad firmly to the chest wall.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Figure 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Conceptual illustration of the position of the crutch during the crutch stance
phase</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1753-g003"/></fig> shows a conceptual illustration of this idea. At crutch contact, the shoulder joint
is in a position of flexion, adduction and internal rotation because the crutch is grounded
in front of the body. Therefore the crutch is located in an IRP. From crutch contact to mid
stance, the body is moving forward. Throughout this period the shoulder joint extends; then,
both the shoulder joint and the crutch rotate from the IRP toward an externally rotated
position (ERP). Around mid stance, the crutch is located by the side of the body. From mid
stance to crutch off, the body continues to move forward and the crutch is positioned to the
rear of the body. Throughout this period the shoulder joint extends, adducts and externally
rotates and the crutch continues to externally rotate. Accordingly, we showed that the
crutch was grounded in an IRP, and then rotated externally throughout the crutch stance
phase and was taken off the floor in an ERP.</p><p>In this study, we found that this movement pattern was present for 10 of the 16 subjects
that showed a statistically significant difference in crutch angle across the three phases.
For four of the 16 subjects the crutch was located in an ERP at crutch contact and for the
remaining two subjects the crutch was located in an IRP at crutch off. However, all 16
subjects the crutch externally rotated from crutch contract to toward crutch off, showing a
similar pattern to that illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>. We
propose that these 16 subjects were able to hold the axillary pad stably against the chest
wall because of the relative positions of the crutch and the chest wall. For two of the
remaining three subjects the crutch maintained a similar angle throughout the crutch stance
phase, and for one subject the crutch internally rotated throughout the crutch stance phase.
We propose that these three subjects had an unstable connection between the axillary pad and
the chest wall because of the relative positions of the crutch and the chest wall.
Therefore, we conclude that external rotation of both the shoulder joint and the crutch was
important for holding the axillary pad against the chest wall.</p><p>Maximum weight-bearing by the crutch usually occurs around mid stance. If the crutch
externally rotates around the time of mid stance, it will be held stably to the chest wall
at this time. As a result, the axillary pad will not easily separate from the axilla, even
if a large movement in the anterior-posterior direction is exerted on the crutch. In
contrast, the axillary pad would easily separate from the axilla if it were not sufficiently
fixed to the chest wall due to internal rotation or lack of rotation. Sasaki et al.
suggested that a horizontally positioned shoulder joint was important to ensure that the
crutch axillary pad is securely positioned against the chest wall. Additionally, the results
of our study suggest that external rotation of both the shoulder joint and the crutch is
important for holding the axillary pad against the chest wall during the crutch stance
phase. Therefore, not only the position but also appropriate rotation of the crutch is
necessary for a stable connection between the axillary pad and the chest wall.</p><p>In conventional instructions for crutch use, users are asked to put the axillary pad
tightly under their arm. However, we think this instruction is not sufficient, and that
crutch users should be instructed to externally rotate the crutch during the crutch stance
in order to decrease the likelihood of the axillary pad separating from the axilla, thereby
reducing the risk of a fall.</p><p>In conclusion, we are confident that our study reproduced the 30% partial weight bearing
crutch walking from the ground reaction force data. Accordingly, we think that the subjects
successfully imitated the crutch walking of patients in our experiment. However, because the
subjects were healthy, their physical ability to support the affected side was different
from that of patients. Therefore, we think our findings are not sufficient to recommend
their application in clinical settings. Further studies of kinetic analysis of the crutch,
comparison of the crutch walking pattern, and selection of the subjects are needed to
confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Part of this work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25560273 and Grants-in-Aid for
