Many methods exist to measure cellular electrical activity; identifying which populations of channels are active under specific physiological or pathophysiological conditions, however, has presented more of a challenge. <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Tilley et al. (2014)</xref> tackled this challenge by developing molecular reporters that show state-dependent binding to the Kv2.1 potassium channel voltage sensor as prototypes of such activity-reporting probes. Noting that spider venoms contain numerous toxins that target the voltage sensors of ion channels, Tilley et al. synthesized labeled forms of the tarantula toxin guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX), which selectively binds Kv2 channels, that, like the parent toxin, produced a positive shift in Kv2.1 activation voltage. A fluorescently labeled form of GxTX colocalized with Kv2.1 channels in CHO-K1 cells and neurons and reported channel activation: after determining that GxTX binding was state dependent (with lower affinity for activated than resting channels), the authors showed that depolarization decreased the association of fluorescent GxTX with Kv2.1-expressing cells. Moreover, cells expressing Kv2.1 channels bound in a voltage-dependent manner to a GxTX variant conjugated to microbeads, providing a potential approach to identifying previously unknown activity-dependent ligands for voltage-gated ion channels. The authors conclude that modified voltage-sensor toxins can be used as highly selective optical monitors of specific channel types in living cells.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><caption><p>Model illustrating ligand binding within the cleft of the AMPAR ligand-binding domain leading first to &#x0201c;clamshell&#x0201d; closure and then to either the open or desensitized state.

For instance, TARPS slow AMPAR deactivation and desensitization and increase glutamate potency as well as increase the efficacy of the partial agonist kainite and convert CNQX from an antagonist into a partial agonist. The AMPAR ligand-binding domain has been described as a &#x0201c;clamshell-like&#x0201d; structure, with ligand binding within the cleft promoting a more closed conformation of the clamshell, thereby leading to channel opening or desensitization. In this issue, <related-article id="d35e106" related-article-type="article-reference" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1085/jgp.201411287">MacLean et al.</related-article> used a combination of electrophysiological and fluorescence-based approaches to investigate the structural basis whereby the prototypical TARP stargazin affects AMPAR gating. Stargazin rescued gating defects in mutant forms of the AMPAR in which closed cleft conformations are destabilized (consistent with its stabilizing the closed state) and slowed binding of the bulky antagonist NBQX (consistent with reduced accessibility of the binding site). Moreover, luminescence resonance energy transfer indicated that stargazin promoted cleft closure regardless of ligand binding. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al. (2014)</xref> thus propose that stargazin promotes closure of the clamshell to potentiate AMPAR signaling.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><caption><p>(A) KcsA potassium channel, indicating ion-binding sites in the selectivity filter.

Whereas basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in <italic>osca1</italic> plants was similar to that in wild-type plants, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to solutions containing sorbitol, or various other osmolytes, was attenuated, whereas that to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was not.

Genetic analysis indicated that the <italic>osca1</italic> phenotype was caused by a recessive mutation in a single nuclear gene, and <italic>OSCA1</italic> was identified as a previously unknown gene encoding a 772&#x02013;amino acid protein. OSCA1 was expressed in leaves, flowers, roots, and guard cells, and was located at the cell surface. When heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, OSCA1 localized to the plasma membrane, mediated sorbitol-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and functioned as a nonselective cation channel. OSCA1 thus appears to represent a hyperosmolarity-activated calcium-permeable channel involved in the plant response to osmotic stress that may function as a plant osmosensor.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hummer</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><year>2014</year>
