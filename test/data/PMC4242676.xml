<italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) is the most widely used live attenuated vaccine. However, the correlates of protection and waning of its immunity against tuberculosis is poorly understood. In this study, we correlated the longitudinal changes in the magnitude and functional quality of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response over a period of two years after mucosal or parenteral BCG vaccination with the strength of protection against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in mice. The BCG vaccination-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited comparable response kinetics but distinct functional attributes in-terms of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF-&#x003b1; co-production and CD62L memory marker expression. Despite a near life-long BCG persistence and the induction of enduring CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses characterized by IFN-&#x003b3; and/or TNF-&#x003b1; production with comparable protection, the protective efficacy waned regardless of the route of vaccination. The progressive decline in the multifactorial functional abilities of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in-terms of type-1 cytokine production, proliferation and cytolytic potential corresponded with the waning of protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In addition, simultaneous increase in the dysfunctional and terminally-differentiated T cells expressing CTLA-4, KLRG-1 and IL-10 during the contraction phase of BCG-induced response coincided with the loss of protection. Our results question the empirical development of BCG-booster vaccines and emphasize the pursuit of strategies that maintain superior T-cell functional capacity. Furthermore, our results underscore the importance of understanding the comprehensive functional dynamics of antigen-specific T-cell responses in addition to cytokine polyfunctionality in BCG-vaccinated hosts while optimizing novel vaccination strategies against tuberculosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intramural funds and the Georgia Research Alliance grant to SBS, RRA, JEP, and TM Shinnick.

The only vaccine available against TB is <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG),6 an attenuated strain of <italic>M. bovis</italic>. It is the most widely used vaccine in human history, and is recommended in &#x0003e;157 countries <xref rid="pone.0113951-Zwerling1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. BCG efficiently prevents severe forms of childhood TB <xref rid="pone.0113951-Colditz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Trunz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but has highly variable efficacy against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults <xref rid="pone.0113951-Fine1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Colditz2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, extensive research efforts are ongoing to develop new TB vaccines with superior protective efficacy. Since over 4 billion individuals have received BCG to date, it is generally accepted that the development of new vaccination strategies should consider the extensive BCG-vaccination coverage <xref rid="pone.0113951-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113951-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Accordingly, future vaccination against TB would involve priming with BCG or an improved live mycobacterial vaccine followed by a boost with subunit vaccine <xref rid="pone.0113951-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A standard approach for screening new vaccine candidates or strategies to improve BCG-induced immunity starts with the evaluation of immunogenicity and protective efficacy in animal models of TB, in particular, the mouse model. However, despite being at the center of new TB vaccination strategies and its extensive use as a reference standard in many preclinical and clinical vaccine trials, our knowledge of the protective immune responses induced by a near century old BCG vaccine is limited in mice and humans.</p><p>Although it is known that BCG induces durable immunity in the mouse model <xref rid="pone.0113951-Goonetilleke1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113951-Kaveh1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, understanding of the kinetics of immune response in-terms of expansion, peak and contraction of the T-cell and antibody response is incomplete, and the optimal time to boost BCG-immunity is uncertain. These gaps have hampered the development of effective prime-boost vaccination regimens using BCG. As boosting T-cell responses during the expansion phase may lead to T-cell exhaustion and activation-induced cell death <xref rid="pone.0113951-Wherry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-JelleyGibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, boosting would be most desirable after the effector phase of BCG-primed responses and when the memory T-cell population is established <xref rid="pone.0113951-Soares1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We reasoned that the evaluation of growth and persistence of BCG after different routes of administration in mice and the simultaneous investigation of the kinetics of the magnitude and functional quality of T-cell responses generated, together with the longitudinal changes in the protective efficacy against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) challenge, may provide an important insight into the correlates of protection and factors associated with the waning of BCG-immunity.</p><p>The BCG vaccine is most commonly administered to newborns by the intradermal route. A recent clinical trial in infants has, however, demonstrated equivalent protective efficacy using intradermal and percutaneous vaccination routes <xref rid="pone.0113951-Hawkridge1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, TB is primarily a respiratory disease and it has been hypothesized that vaccination directed at the respiratory mucosa may provide the best opportunity for protection against infection with <italic>Mtb</italic>. The animal experimental evidence suggests that local immune defense mechanisms might be crucial for the protective immunity against TB, for example, those stimulated by mucosal immunization via the lower respiratory tract <xref rid="pone.0113951-Horvath1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Beverley1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, we investigated the dynamics of BCG immunity traversing the entire life-span of mice following intranasal (i.n., mucosal) and subcutaneous (s.c., parenteral) vaccination.</p><p>Our results showed that BCG-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and protection peak between 12&#x02013;32 weeks but wanes significantly by 78 weeks regardless of i.n. or s.c. vaccination. The magnitude of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with sound multi-effector capacity in-terms of type-1 cytokine production, proliferation and cytolytic potential correlated best with protection against <italic>Mtb</italic>. Notably, increase in the dysfunctional and terminally-differentiated T cells coincided with the waning of BCG-induced protection. Our results provide previously undocumented important insight into how BCG persistence and the immune senescence affect T-cell functionality in mice and highlight the need to develop vaccination strategies that prevent T-cell attrition and exhaustion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>BCG persists and induces a durable cell-mediated immune response in mice</title><p>To understand the growth and persistence of BCG after mucosal or parenteral vaccination, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 10<sup>6</sup> BCG Copenhagen colony forming units (CFU) by i.n. and s.c. route, and BCG titers were determined in the lung and spleen at 7 different time points. BCG vaccination by the i.n. route resulted in a high bacillary load in the lung. About 0.2&#x02013;0.5% of the total BCG administered following i.n. vaccination was detected in the lung at 48 h, while BCG could not be detected in the lung at 48 h after s.c. vaccination and only a low numbers of bacilli (45&#x000b1;14 CFU) were detected in the lung at week 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113951-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the spleen, peak BCG load was found at week 3 after s.c. vaccination while it took 6 weeks for BCG to be detected following i.n. vaccination. The BCG CFUs declined by week 12 to 32 but persisted at very low or undetectable levels until week 52. However, by week 78, BCG burden resurged in the two organs of both vaccinated groups.

The frequencies of WCL-specific IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-17 and IL-4 spot-forming units (SFU) were measured using a cultured ELISPOT assay. Although i.n. vaccination-induced total cytokine SFU peaked earlier in the lungs (i.e., at week 12) than those produced by s.c. vaccination (which peaked at week 32), the magnitude of WCL-specific total cytokine response in two organs was statistically comparable between the routes of vaccination when the total SFU at 7 different time points were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113951-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The total cytokine response by either route was dominated by higher frequencies and proportions of IFN-&#x003b3; SFU, although at the peak of response the frequencies of IL-17 SFU were significantly greater compared to early (6 week) and late (78 week) time points in the lung. These results suggest that though BCG vaccination induced type-1 immune response declines with age, the nature of response continues to be predominantly type-1 after i.n. or s.c vaccination</p><p>When the antibody response was investigated in the sera of two vaccinated groups, we observed similar kinetics for WCL-specific IgG-antibody response by ELISA, but it was significant only in the sera of s.c.

The WCL-specific IgG response was characterized by greater proportions of IgG2a and IgG2b subclass antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113951.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that i.n. and s.c. BCG vaccination induces a strong cell-mediated response following early bacillary load and is maintained for more than 8 months. The peak of immune response in the lung and spleen coincides with decrease in the BCG burden and persistence of bacilli at very low levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>BCG vaccination-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells exhibit distinct cytokine profile</title><p>To understand the temporal changes in the magnitude and quality of BCG-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, we evaluated the frequencies of WCL- and short term culture filtrate (STCF)-specific IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF-&#x003b1;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung, spleen, draining and distant lymph nodes (LNs) by polychromatic flow cytometry.

In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were polyfunctional at the peak, and the response was dominated by higher magnitudes of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; single- and double-positive cells. These results demonstrate that BCG vaccination generates CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses of distinct quality. Contrary to the belief that BCG vaccination induces a weak CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response <xref rid="pone.0113951-Grode1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, these data demonstrate the significant presence of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at peak time points. Although the percentages of WCL-specific total cytokine-producing cells among CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were comparable, the frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the T lymphocytes (CD3<sup>+</sup>) of the organs investigated were approximately three-fold higher than the frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby confirming the dominance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response after BCG vaccination during the entire response kinetics in mice.</p><p>The BCG-induced early T-cell responses tend to be strongest in the compartments most proximal to the site of vaccine administration <xref rid="pone.0113951-Sable1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and it is believed that the distribution of specific T cells may become uniform in the local and distant compartments as the vaccination-induced immune response matures. Therefore, we investigated the specific T-cell responses simultaneously in the draining and distant LNs after i.n. and s.c. BCG vaccination at 5 different time points. Vaccination by the i.n. route induced higher WCL-specific cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the draining superficial cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), while s.c. vaccination induced more T-cell responses in the inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) which drains the flank (the site of s.c. vaccination) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Responses in the draining CLNs of i.n.-vaccinated and ILNs of s.c.-vaccinated group also peaked at week 32, but, significantly higher magnitudes (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) of WCL-specific T cells were observed only in the corresponding draining LNs as compared to the distant LNs at all 5 time points investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate a near lifelong compartmentalization of T-cell responses in the draining LNs depending on the route of BCG vaccination.</p><p>Furthermore, the mean frequencies of WCL-specific T cells waned after week 32 in the two vaccinated groups with significantly higher polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at week 32 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) compared to week 78 in the three organs investigated, demonstrating decline in the magnitude and quality of BCG vaccination-induced T-cell response. By week 104, the magnitude of WCL-specific cytokine-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells had waned to levels similar to those observed at week 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), and we observed similar T-cell cytokine response dynamics using <italic>Mtb</italic> STCF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113951.s002">Fig. S2A and S2B</xref>).

Together, these data demonstrate the gradual waning of BCG-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses after 32 weeks of vaccination, regardless of the route of administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>BCG-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express cytolytic potential that wanes with time</title><p>To further characterize the temporal changes in the quality of BCG-induced T cells, we assessed the degranulation potential of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, measured as the surface mobilization of CD107a and CD107b <xref rid="pone.0113951-Kannanganat1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Betts1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Casazza1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

In our study, the frequency of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific total or polyfunctional Th1 cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was about two-fold more at the peak (week 32) compared to the expansion phase (week 12), but the levels of protection after <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge was not significantly different. Furthermore, the protection was higher at week 12 compared to week 78, despite comparable magnitudes of BCG-induced T-cell responses. Hence, the correlation between the magnitude of total cytokine-producing T cells or polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the degree of protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge, although positive, appears to be rather weak. Previously, it has been reported that the frequency of BCG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and polyfunctional Th1 cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the blood does not correlate with the protection against TB in BCG-vaccinated children <xref rid="pone.0113951-Kagina1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The increased BCG-burden during the contraction phase and the concurrent decrease in the magnitude and functionality of type-1 cytokine-producing specific T cells is in agreement with previously described negative association between the functional capacity of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T cells and <italic>Mtb</italic> load in the sputum of TB patients <xref rid="pone.0113951-Millington1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>It is known that persistent, low-dose antigenic stimulation throughout life may compromise antigen-specific T cells in two ways. First, they may become functionally exhausted and lose essential functional activity that is necessary for immune protection. Second, repeated T-cell stimulation can lead to a loss of the replicative capacity of some antigen-specific T cell populations, as a result of telomere erosion and/or unrepaired DNA damage, a process known as replicative senescence (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0113951-Akbar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). The induction of senescence in T cells is also known to limit the long-term persistence of immune responses during aging <xref rid="pone.0113951-NikolichZugich1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, the attrition of specific T-cell responses discerned in our study can be attributed in part to the onset of immune senescence associated with the advancing age in BCG-vaccinated mice. The terminally-differentiated and senescent T cells are characterized by the up-regulation of KLRG-1 expression <xref rid="pone.0113951-Henson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, while functionally exhausted T cells are defined by the early loss of IL-2 production, decreased proliferation, and the increased expression of inhibitory markers like CTLA-4 and PD-1 with low levels of T<sub>CM</sub> markers CD62L and CCR-7 <xref rid="pone.0113951-Wherry3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Wherry4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Blackburn1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Although the terms senescence and exhaustion are often used interchangeably when referring to highly differentiated T cells, available data suggest that both processes are regulated independently of each other <xref rid="pone.0113951-Akbar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It should be noted that the onset of the contraction of specific T-cell responses in our study was chronicled at the week 52 in BCG-vaccinated mice i.e., at the adult mid-life, and significantly increased expression of KLRG-1 and CTLA-4 was found during the contraction phase on the T cells of BCG-vaccinated mice compared to those of age-matched na?ve mice. In addition, we found comparable magnitudes of specific T-cell cytokine responses in elderly (104-week-old) and younger (8-week-old) mice, 6 weeks post BCG vaccination. Old mice (24-month-old) have been previously shown to effectively control early <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0113951-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Vesosky1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, and the BCG vaccination has been found to be equally protective in young, adult and old guinea pigs against TB <xref rid="pone.0113951-KomineAizawa1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Therefore, decreased functional abilities of T cells during the contraction phase of BCG-response observed in our study may not be only due to the advanced-age-related senescence in mice, and it is probable that the chronic persistence of BCG with low grade continuous antigen stimulation throughout life contributes to the attrition of T-cell functions and precipitates immune senescence.</p><p>Like <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0113951-HenaoTamayo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, BCG-induced responses in our study were dominated by CD4<sup>+</sup> effector/T<sub>EM</sub> subset secreting IFN-&#x003b3; and/or TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0113951-Orme2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, and the frequency of IL-2<sup>+</sup> T cells was much lower compared to that reported previously after protective subunit vaccination of mice <xref rid="pone.0113951-Lindenstrom2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Even though CD44<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in our study suggested an acquisition of the T<sub>CM</sub> phenotype <xref rid="pone.0113951-Kamath1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, these cells did not produce IL-2 during the contraction phase and showed concurrent impaired proliferative capacity contrary to the earlier reported characteristics of classical T<sub>CM</sub> cells <xref rid="pone.0113951-Sallusto1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Harari1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Multiple human and mouse studies have also shown that BCG primarily promotes effector/T<sub>EM</sub> cells <xref rid="pone.0113951-Kaveh1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Soares2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Many factors may influence development of a long-lived and high-quality memory T cells and of these, antigen load and persistence may be the most important ones <xref rid="pone.0113951-Harari2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Our study provides a direct evidence for the chronic persistence of BCG load and its correlation with the poor central memory T-cell responses in mice. Previous observations of improved T<sub>CM</sub> responses after clearance of <italic>Mtb</italic> or BCG in mice and their association with protection provide additional evidence for the correlation between chronic persistence of BCG and poor T<sub>CM</sub> responses <xref rid="pone.0113951-Andersen2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113951-Jagannath1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Paradoxically, the protective efficacy of BCG in mice also appears to be dependent on the presence of viable bacilli <xref rid="pone.0113951-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and consequently on the T<sub>EM</sub> responses. Recently, greater CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> responses induced by recombinant BCG &#x00394;<italic>ureC</italic>::<italic>hly</italic> vaccine (rBCG) have been shown to be responsible for superior protection compared to canonical BCG against <italic>Mtb</italic> and the T<sub>CM</sub> responses are shown to coincide with the faster clearance of rBCG in mice <xref rid="pone.0113951-Vogelzang1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. It has been suggested that the canonical BCG is cleared more rapidly in humans than mice and influence the memory phenotype (especially T<sub>CM</sub> phenotype) of BCG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0113951-Soares1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, in this study <xref rid="pone.0113951-Soares1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed characteristics of both central memory (CCR7<sup>+</sup> expression) and effector memory (predominant cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; and cytotoxic marker expression) following contraction and exhibited a more complex and different phenotype than the classical IL-2<sup>+</sup>T<sub>CM</sub> cells. The growth and persistence of BCG in humans is not known with certainty, and reports of BCG-lymphadenitis or dissemination years after BCG vaccination are used to support a relatively long life-span of this vaccine in humans <xref rid="pone.0113951-Hofstadler1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113951-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. On the other hand, one would argue that disseminated BCG infections in HIV infected patients and children are not frequent complications or common findings <xref rid="pone.0113951-Waddell1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>; supporting the viewpoint that viable BCG probably does not persist in children for a long period of time after vaccination. We agree that some aspects of the BCG growth observed in mice such as the resurgence of BCG-burden during the contraction phase of immune response may not necessarily occur in immunocompetent humans and rather this may be a phenomenon seen only in susceptible animal models and children with immune gene deficiency <xref rid="pone.0113951-Jouanguy1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Like reported observations in mice <xref rid="pone.0113951-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, BCG-induced immunity is thought to wane with time after vaccination at birth in humans and is generally considered to last no more than 10&#x02013;15 year <xref rid="pone.0113951-Sterne1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. However, the time frame for the waning of BCG in humans is still a subject of debate, and a long-term protective efficacy of BCG in some populations has been reported <xref rid="pone.0113951-Aronson1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. It is generally agreed, nevertheless, that the waning of BCG-induced protection through childhood and young adult life coincides with the gradual increase in TB incidence in highly TB-endemic regions, which reaches peak in the 25&#x02013;35-year-old age group <xref rid="pone.0113951-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Overall, caution is merited while comparing longitudinal changes in BCG-induced immune responses in mice with those observed in humans.</p><p>The persistent antigen load in chronic viral infections and active TB in humans is known to be associated with a progressive impairment of T-cell responses <xref rid="pone.0113951-Wherry2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Blackburn1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, and up-regulation of markers of T-cell dysfunction, terminal differentiation and exhaustion <xref rid="pone.0113951-Wherry4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Bucks1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In our study, BCG-induced response during the contraction phase was characterized by an increased expression of KLRG-1, CTLA-4 and IL-10 production, reduced ability to recall T-cell responses following <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge and loss of protection against <italic>Mtb</italic>. However, we did not observe significant changes in the PD-1 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during the three phases of BCG-induced response and our results are at odds with the previous study <xref rid="pone.0113951-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, which documented PD-1 expression on T cells after a high-dose intravenous BCG infection of mice. It has been previously shown that the BCG-vaccinated adults harbor early-stage-differentiated, low PD-1-expressing antigen-specific effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells while BCG-vaccinated, latent TB infected (LTBI) adults had late-stage-differentiated PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0113951-Adekambi1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, and the advanced TB patients harbor PD-1<sup>+</sup> severely exhausted T cells with compromised IFN-&#x003b3; production <xref rid="pone.0113951-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113951-Sable2" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that the resurgence of BCG growth at the late time point (78 weeks) in our study could be due to the lack of immune control and attrition of T-cell functions. However, since BCG CFUs were not enumerated at 104-week time point, this needs further investigation. Overall, our results suggest that the multifactorial functional ability of BCG-induced T cells in-terms of type-1 cytokine production, proliferative and cytotoxic potential and ability to recall immune-mediators post <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge likely correlate with the superior protection against TB. These results also suggest a need to look beyond the quantitative measures of few cytokine markers of vaccine-induced Th1 cells, with improved focus on the combined functional abilities of different immune subsets.</p><p>Our results have several implications for the development of effective vaccination strategies using BCG or other live TB vaccines. Although parenteral BCG vaccination via skin was sufficient to induce a durable protective immunity in the lung, our observation of the life-long route-specific compartmentalization of T-cell responses in the draining LNs has important ramifications for the development of effective prime-boost vaccination strategies. The administration of a booster vaccine by a homologous route, involving the same draining LNs as the primer vaccine, may be an effective strategy to induce a superior booster effect in prime-boost scenarios. The ideal time to boost BCG-primed T-cell responses in the mouse model might be after the expansion and peak phase i.e. at week 52 or thereafter. This viewpoint is further supported by a recent data from our laboratory, where boosting with Apa (Rv1860)-based subunit vaccine during the contraction phase offered a stronger boost and imparted significant protection <xref rid="pone.0113951-Nandakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. The data also reinforces the fact that in most published vaccine studies, mice are challenged far too quickly <xref rid="pone.0113951-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and the longer vaccination-to-challenge intervals, such as 6&#x02013;8 months after BCG vaccination, will provide better information about the protective efficacy of preclinical vaccines against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in the mouse model. Further, the loss of protection during the chronic phase of BCG growth and the corresponding increase in KLRG-1<sup>+</sup> and CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> T cells highlight the need to develop strategies which can overcome these inhibitory signals and promote a highly distinct or superior quality T-cell responses. One such approach based on our observations could be a rIL-2 therapy to rescue dysfunctional T cells <xref rid="pone.0113951-West1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Recently, it was demonstrated that BCG-mediated protection is lost as <italic>Mtb</italic> infection enters the chronic phase in C57BL/6 mice, but a single boost with H1-subunit vaccine could selectively promote CD4<sup>+</sup>KLRG-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> cells and impart long-term protection <xref rid="pone.0113951-Lindenstrom3" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, which suggests that strategies to prolong BCG-efficacy without T-cell exhaustion could be pursued.</p><p>Overall, our study provided a comprehensive portrait of longitudinal changes in the specific T-cell responses following BCG vaccination in the mouse model. The data suggest an association between the functional capacities of BCG-induced T cells and levels of protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> and provide a rationale for future longitudinal studies optimizing novel prime-boost vaccination strategies and understanding the mechanisms of loss of BCG-induced protection in young adults from the regions of high prevalence of <italic>Mtb</italic> infections. It is a well-established fact that BCG provides the lowest level of protection against TB in the regions with the highest prevalence of latent infection <xref rid="pone.0113951-Fine1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and the caveat is that the certain aspects of the dynamics of BCG-immunity in mice may not inevitably embody human responses. In the light of results presented here, however, it is reasonable to envisage that repeated <italic>Mtb</italic> and environmental mycobacteria exposure and prevalent latent infections in these human populations may further exacerbate T-cell attrition and exhaustion leading to breakdown in BCG-induced anti-TB immunity. Since BCG vaccination-induced T-cell responses mirror those reported by an actual <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in mice and humans, our results indicate that a successful novel TB vaccine should re-educate the immune system rather than reproducing the natural immune responses generated by <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal experiments performed were in strict accordance with the guidelines of the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Animals and the Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
