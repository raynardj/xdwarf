Diagnosis of COPD was based on postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) being &#x0003c;0.7. Patients were included in the study when baseline anthropometric characteristics, FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio had been recorded, along with at least one outcome measure (exercise capacity, dyspnoea score, or a HRQL questionnaire). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of asthma or heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) III-IV) were excluded. The collation of data from the different programmes was approved by the Riverside Research Ethics Committee.</p><p>All programmes followed British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines regarding a combination of aerobic and strength training. The programme included a mixture of two supervised sessions and one or more unsupervised home exercise sessions each week over 8&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks. Exercise prescription was based on the outcome of initial exercise assessment and was increased through the programme as tolerated. Programmes were multidisciplinary with an educational component covering issues including exercise (which was recommended during the programme and was to continue after its completion), medication use, diet and coping strategies, according to BTS recommendations.</p><p>All patients underwent an initial evaluation before the beginning of the programme and a second evaluation immediately after PR completion. Patients with COPD who completed at least 75% of the designated PR programme and returned for the follow-up evaluation were characterised as completers. Demographic characteristics and pulmonary function testing variables were recorded only once (before PR), while dyspnoea score, exercise capacity measurements, anxiety and depression scale scores and HRQL variables were recorded for COPD completers prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Measurements</title><p>Pulmonary function testing was completed according to established guidelines.

Participants who completed PR had less severe disease with HRQoL the only independent predictor, but it was those with the most severe disease who derived the greatest benefit. Improvement in different aspects following PR was generally measure-specific so no single baseline factor could predict improvement in exercise capacity as well as health status.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>PR completion</title><p>The study identifies a paradox: those most likely to benefit from PR appear least likely to complete it. Approximately 57% of patients with COPD completed the programme consistent with previous UK data.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Others have reported much higher rates of PR completion ranging from more than 80%<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> to approximately 70%.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Clinical practice differs from the controlled environment of clinical trials where patients have made a commitment to participation by signing a consent form, have fewer comorbidities and are usually under closer follow-up. Moreover, the definition of PR completion varies; in the current study completers attended at least 75% of sessions and returned for a follow-up visit, while other authors have used much lower thresholds to define PR completion,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> so results are not easily comparable.</p><p>The specific reasons for not completing PR were not systematically collected and, thus, could not be further analysed in the current study. Keating <italic>et al</italic> reported that being unwell, having major difficulties travelling to the PR centre, inconvenient running hours of the programme, family issues, work responsibilities, lack of social support and lack of perceived benefit were the most common reasons of dropping out from a PR programme in a small group of 18 patients with COPD.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Identifying the barriers of PR attendance and completion in real-life PR settings is an area of further research, as resolving them could give the essential input for patients to complete the PR programme.</p><p>CAT score was the only independent predictor of PR completion, with completers having lower baseline CAT scores, indicating a better health status.

In a cohort of 51 patients, Garrod <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> have previously shown that depressed patients were in a significantly higher risk of drop-out compared to non-depressed patients. However, that study utilised the Brief Assessment Schedule Depression Cards and not the HAD-D score, in order to assess depression. In another cohort of 111 COPD outpatients enrolled in a community based programme, better mood independently predicted PR completion among female participants. In this study depression was assessed utilising another tool, the Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CED-D).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Several reliable, adult, self-report measures of depression, such as the PHQ-9, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the CED-D,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>

Troosters <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> reported that patients with reduced exercise capacity and reduced respiratory and peripheral muscle strength were more likely to improve after attendance at PR.</p><p>For the various HRQoL measures the achievement of the MCID was best predicted by a worse baseline value (CAT score, CRDQ-D, E, F). A higher MRC dyspnoea score at baseline also predicted improvement in CRDQ emotional function and fatigue domains and was the only predictor of improvement in CRDQ-M. In a previous study, Selzler <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> failed to identify any predictor of improvement in HRQoL; however, this study utilised the SF-36 and the SGRQ. In another study, Garrod <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> identified a higher baseline 6MWT as the only predictor of improvement in HRQoL, assessed by the use of SGRQ. No baseline physiological measurement has yet been shown to predict significant improvements in HRQoL.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>The greatest improvements in anxiety and depression were in those with the highest scores at baseline, which is understandable, as PR would not be expected to relieve a condition that was not present. PR is partly effective as a behavioural therapy, with graded exposure to dyspnoea and learning coping strategies similar to the sort of approaches applied in cognitive behavioural therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Methodological issues</title><p>The use of different outcome measures across the participating study sites is a limitation of the current study; however, it reflects the variability of baseline clinical assessment in real life PR settings. Moreover, PR outcomes were evaluated based on the MCID, an approach which minimises the variability of measures applied. A strength of the study is that it reflects clinical practice with a less selected population than is generally recruited to clinical trials and thus has greater relevance. Data were entered prospectively onto a clinical database and then anonymised by local staff before being collated centrally, meaning that source verification was not possible. It is unlikely that this would have introduced any systematic bias. The clinical data available were limited being based on those collected routinely as part of the various PR programmes, so other factors such as motivation, sociodemographic status and reasons for drop-out could not be considered. Moreover, some missing data on baseline evaluation of exercise capacity and/or HRQL reduce somewhat the study sample size; however, this is a random phenomenon, unlikely to have produced any systematic bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study suggests that those with the worst health status may need additional support to continue to attend and complete PR programmes with possible strategies including support for transport and lay-support. Non-completion is an event rather than a permanent state and health practitioners should review reasons for non-completion with patients, reinforce the benefits, and encourage further participation as appropriate.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AKB and RJT contributed substantially in study design, data collection, analysis and interpretation and manuscript drafting.
