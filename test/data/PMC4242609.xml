One mechanism by which intercellular communication is achieved is through the transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes are EVs that carry lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins and are detectable in most biological fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we report that CSF EV concentrations undergo age dependent fluctuations. We characterized EV RNA content by next generation small RNA sequencing and miRNA microarray analysis and identified a temporal shift in CSF EV content. CSF EVs encapsulated miRNAs that contain a conserved hnRNPA2/B1 recognition sequence. We found that hnRNPA2/B1-containing EVs were produced by choroid plexus epithelial cells and that hnRNPA2/B1 containing EVs decreased with age. These results provide insight into EV exchange of miRNAs within the central nervous system and a framework to understand how changes in EVs may have an important impact on brain development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by Clemson University and the Clemson University Creative Inquiry Program.

Although microvesicles can bud from the cell membrane, exosomes are distinct and are thought to originate upon membrane invagination of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) <italic>via</italic> an ESCRT-dependent pathway and are released when MVBs fuse to the cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0113116-Heijnen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Exosomes bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans on recipient cells, fuse with the plasma membrane, and subsequently transfer their content <xref rid="pone.0113116-Christianson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since EVs carry proteins, mRNA, and microRNA (miRNA) to target cells, they are unique in that they have the potential for multilayer regulation of cellular physiology which contrasts the top-down signaling coordinated by classical ligand activated receptors. Thus, EVs represent a mechanism for coordinating complex physiological processes and may play an important role in maturation of the CNS.</p><p>EVs are detectable in most biological fluids including CSF <xref rid="pone.0113116-Feliciano1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113116-Vella1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113116-Chiasserini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. CSF EVs encapsulate miRNA during embryonic development in rodents and humans and may promote neural stem cell (NSC) amplification <xref rid="pone.0113116-Feliciano1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the role that EVs and, in particular, exosomes may play within the CNS may depend on the source from which they originate and the target cell. For example, CSF exosomes from Alzheimer's patients can induce astrocytic cell death <xref rid="pone.0113116-Saman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Alternatively, the choroid plexus, which produces CSF, may transfer EVs thereby shuttling folate to the parenchyma <xref rid="pone.0113116-Grapp1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, the quantity, biochemical characteristics, and content of CSF EVs remain undefined.</p><p>Here, we describe that CSF EVs are subject to age dependent fluctuations. These EVs are abundant during perinatal development but precipitously decline throughout life. Next generation sequencing of EV content identified novel small RNAs as well as those previously described. The miRNA content within the CSF EVs was also dependent on age and these miRNAs contain a previously described sorting consensus sequence recognized by hnRNPs <xref rid="pone.0113116-VillarroyaBeltri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In agreement, our data show that the CSF EVs contain hnRNPA2/B1and these EVs were subject to age dependent declines. Additionally, the choroid plexus produces hnRNPA2/B1 containing EVs. Taken together, these results highlight that CSF EVs and their contents undergo temporal fluctuations during brain development and that these changes may be of physiological significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CSF tracking analysis and EV isolation</title><p>Human CSF was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Samples were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 2,000&#x000d7;g for 15 minutes. 800 &#x000b5;L samples were shipped on dry ice to the Nanomedicine Characterization Core facility in the Center for Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery at UNC at Chapel Hill. Samples were handled in a laminar flow hood, sequentially thawed at room temperature, and then diluted 20&#x02013;500 fold based on an initial run with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (10 mM salt) and if required, additionally diluted 100 fold. Samples were then loaded onto a pre-cleaned and pre-warmed (30 minutes) Nanosight NS 500 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight, NanoSight Ltd, UK) equipped with green laser (532 nm) illumination. Mean size and particle concentration values were calculated by the nanoparticle tracking software which allows analysis of video images for calculation of the diffusion coefficient, sphere equivalent, mean-square displacement, and hydrodynamic radius of particles by using the Strokes-Einstein equation. The Nanosight NS 500 was calibrated with 100 nm polystyrene latex microsphere standards (Nanosight Ltd, UK) and all experiments were performed at a stabilized temperature of 23.3&#x000b0;C. Three to twenty-eight runs were performed for each sample. For isolation of vesicles and vesicle contents, where specified, pre-cleared CSF supernatant (or cell culture media) was placed onto a GE Healthcare S400-HR sephacryl column and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 735&#x000d7;g. EVs were precipitated using total exosome isolation reagent (from cell culture media), (other fluids isolation), or Exoquick tissue culture media exosome precipitation solution, (Life Technologies and Systems Biosciences).

The Clemson University ORC determined that the project does not involve human subjects as defined in the federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects in research and is, therefore, not subject to IRB review. This project did not involve either &#x0201c;intervention or interaction&#x0201d; with living individuals, or the collection or use of &#x0201c;identifiable private information&#x0201d; about living individuals. Samples were not collected specifically for the described research and no individually identifying information was acquired for these studies. Nevertheless, samples were obtained with consent that samples would be used for manufacturing or research purposes. Samples were handled in accordance with ethical guidelines and regulations for the research use of human tissue set forth by the NIH. All samples were de-identified according to HIPAA standards. Patients were categorized by age. Eleven patients were in categorized in group A and ranged from 11 days to 2 years of age.

These columns extract all molecules up to 30 nm in size which is sufficient to remove LDL or HDL particles (approximately 20 nm). We also used Life Technologies Exosome Tissue Culture, Life Technologies Exosome Other Fluid, or System Biosciences Exosome Tissue Culture Isolation Reagent.

EVs were isolated from human CSF samples using a combination of size exclusion to remove potential lipoprotein contaminants and by polymeric precipitation. EVs isolated in this manner contain immuno-reactivity for general markers of EVs. Reductions in EV concentrations were mirrored by reductions in the EV protein ALIX.</p><p>The average size of CSF EVs did not change during development based on nanoparticle tracking analysis. Although side populations did appear in patients younger than two years of age, there was not a statistically significant shift in the average size. Nanoparticle tracking analysis has the ability to appropriately assign size frequency distributions to relatively uniform populations. However a recent report has demonstrated that mixed size population analysis by nanoparticle tracking analysis yields broad particle size distributions <xref rid="pone.0113116-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This ultimately results in an inability to bin particles into finite size categories with poor multimodal resolution with an inability to often distinguish peak modal values <xref rid="pone.0113116-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> Nevertheless, nanoparticle tracking analysis identified age dependent decreases and this conclusion is supported by the reduction in EV marker proteins.</p><p>We also hypothesized that an additional indicator of age may be the content of CSF EVs. Therefore we started our analysis by subjecting CSF to small RNA next generation sequence analysis. The majority of mapped reads aligned to known microRNA genes. INext generation sequencing also identified RNAs not previously reported. Several of these novel EV RNAs are predicted to base pair with the 3&#x02032; UTR of mRNAs. For example, we found that Cuff .1222 targeted the 3&#x02032; UTR an mRNA with a miTG score of 96.00 using DIANA - microT v3.0. These findings warrant further investigations into whether the novel EV RNAs function as miRNAs.</p><p>Microarrays were performed to determine whether miRNAs were differentially expressed in CSF vesicles based on age. While most highly abundant miRNAs were not differentially expressed under the two conditions, hierarchical analysis classified samples correctly into two groups based on age and identified several differentially expressed miRNAs. Further investigations will be required to determine whether differentially expressed miRNAs have an important role in early brain development.</p><p>More than 50 highly abundant miRNAs were present in each condition. Bioinformatic analysis of highly abundant miRNAs revealed a consensus recognition sequence which contained overlap with a zip-code motif recognized by hnRNPs <xref rid="pone.0113116-VillarroyaBeltri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Indeed, we identified hnRNPA2/B1 in CSF vesicles and found age dependent declines in hnRNPA2/B1 isolated from CSF vesicles. The size of hnRNPA2/B1 that we detected is slightly larger than what is predicted. However, the size hnRNPA2/B1 is consistent with differential sumoylation detected for exosome purified hnRNPA2/B1 <xref rid="pone.0113116-VillarroyaBeltri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We also occasionally found hnRNPA2/B1 immunoreactivity at approximately the predicted size supporting the hypothesis that differential sumoylation may play a role in modulating function within exosomes. Cultures of CPEs did release EVs and also produced EVs that contained hnRNPA2/B1. The significance of hnRNPA2/B1 within CSF vesicles is likely the transport of cellular miRNAs into EVs, although further studies will be needed to address this hypothesis. Our findings that hnRNPA2/B1 may have an important function in CSF EVs are supported by a recent proteomic study has also indicated that many hnRNPs including hnRNPA2/B1 are present in CSF EVs <xref rid="pone.0113116-Chiasserini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In conclusion, the temporal dynamics of CSF EV concentrations and miRNA content likely play an important role in coordinating intercellular and intracellular communication in brain development. This study lays the ground work for realizing the full diagnostic and therapeutic potential of EVs and for deciphering their physiologic functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Human tissue was obtained from University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank which is a Brain and Tissue Repository of the NIH NeuroBioBank.
