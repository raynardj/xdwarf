Here, we show that miR-214 regulates skin morphogenesis and hair follicle (HF) cycling by targeting &#x003b2;-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. miR-214 exhibits differential expression patterns in the skin epithelium, and its inducible overexpression in keratinocytes inhibited proliferation, which resulted in formation of fewer HFs with decreased hair bulb size and thinner hair production. The inhibitory effects of miR-214 on HF development and cycling were associated with altered activities of multiple signaling pathways, including decreased expression of key Wnt signaling mediators &#x003b2;-catenin and Lef-1, and were rescued by treatment with pharmacological Wnt activators. Finally, we identify &#x003b2;-catenin as one of the conserved miR-214 targets in keratinocytes.

HF morphogenesis is driven by bidirectional ectodermal&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions between epidermal keratinocytes and a specialized population of dermal fibroblasts, and results in formation of the hair bulb, in which epithelial progenitor cells proliferate and differentiate into six distinct cell lineages to form the hair shaft and its supporting layers of the inner root sheath (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Millar, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>). HF morphogenesis is governed by a well-balanced interplay between cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which are controlled at several levels including signaling/transcription factor-mediated and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Millar, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Botchkarev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Frye and Benitah, 2012</xref>).</p><p>During postnatal life, HFs undergo cyclic regeneration with periods of active growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative resting (telogen; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Stenn and Paus, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2009</xref>). Initiation of a new growth phase in resting HFs occurs as a result of signaling exchange between epithelial stem cells residing in the bulge/secondary hair germ and dermal papilla fibroblasts, and is driven by the growth stimulatory molecules (Wnt ligands, BMP inhibitors, Shh, TGF-&#x003b2;2, FGF7, FGF10), the effects of which predominate over the growth inhibitory signals generated by the BMP ligands or FGF18 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hsu and Fuchs, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to signaling/transcription factor&#x02013;mediated and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, programs of gene activation and silencing governing HF development and cycling are controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Yi and Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Botchkareva, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ning and Andl, 2013</xref>). miRNAs largely contribute to the regulation of gene expression by fine tuning and buffering the activity of signaling pathways. miRNAs interact with their target complimentary messenger RNAs by base-pairing between 5&#x02032; end sequences of miRNAs and mRNAs sequences located in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032; UTR), which leads to either mRNA destabilization, the inhibition of translation initiation, or both (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ambros, 2001</xref>). In turn, the expression of miRNA can be controlled by cell type&#x02013;specific transcription factors, and a major constituent of the miRNA processing machinery, Dicer, serves as a target gene of p63 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in epithelial cells and melanocytes, respectively (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, miRNAs can alter activities of the signaling pathways not only by targeting their genes, but also by acting as their downstream components (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, miRNAs and their targets represent remarkably diverse regulatory networks, playing a key role in the execution of gene expression programs in stem cells and their progenies (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ambros, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Inui et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent data demonstrated critical roles of miRNAs in controlling the activity of cutaneous stem cells and their lineage-committed progenies that drive skin development and regeneration (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Yi and Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Botchkareva, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ning and Andl, 2013</xref>). Early studies by <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Andl et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al. (2006)</xref> have identified &#x0223c;70 miRNAs expressed in mouse embryonic skin. We have recently shown that expression levels of &#x0003e;200 miRNAs are changed during HF cyclic regeneration in mouse skin (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mardaryev et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that miRNAs play a powerful role in the control of gene expression programs during skin development and hair cycle&#x02013;associated tissue remodeling. Indeed, constitutive epidermal-specific deletion of the miRNA processors <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Dgcr8</italic> results in the severe abnormalities in HF development characterized by the inability of the HFs to invaginate into the dermis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Andl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2006</xref>). Inducible epidermal deletion of <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Drosha</italic> in postnatal mouse skin has also demonstrated the crucial importance of miRNAs in the maintenance of the normal HF growth cycle (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Teta et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Individual miRNAs are involved in controlling the expression of several key regulators of stem cell activity in the skin and HFs: miR-203 controls the proliferative potential of epithelial precursor cells by direct inhibition of p63 expression (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2008</xref>), and miR-125b serves as a rheostat that controls stem cell proliferation, fate commitment, and differentiation (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), while miR-205 is indispensable for stem cell survival (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>). miR-31 is highly expressed in the HF during the anagen phase and controls hair cycle&#x02013;associated tissue remodeling by regulating the expression of several important components of the Wnt, BMP, and FGF signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mardaryev et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although substantial progress has been made in discovering the important players controlling skin and HF development and cycling, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of signaling/transcription networks in the keratinocytes still requires additional efforts. In this study, we aimed to explore a role of miR-214 in HF development and cycling. <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al. (2006)</xref> showed that miR-214 is one of the most abundant miRNAs expressed in the HFs of embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) embryonic skin. Mouse miR-214 is encoded by a primary transcript Dynamin3-opposite strand (Dnm3os; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), deletion of which leads to skeletal abnormalities and a lethal phenotype (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>). The expression of the miR-214 gene is developmentally regulated by Twist-1, a key transcriptional factor controlling epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transitions (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), which is crucial for normal development and tissue repair. It has also been demonstrated that miR-214 plays an important role in controlling the development of the nervous system, teeth, the pancreas, and bone formation (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Joglekar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Sehic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013b</xref>). However, its role in the control of skin and HF development and homeostasis is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that miR-214 show distinct expression patterns in the developing epidermis and HF. Keratinocyte-specific miR-214 overexpression causes a marked decrease in the number of HFs in developing skin, and a delay in anagen progression during postnatal development, which is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation in the epidermis and HFs. These effects are accompanied by dramatic changes in the gene expression and activity of different signaling pathways including Wnt, Shh, Eda, and Bmp, and are rescued by the administration of Wnt pathway activators. Furthermore, we identified &#x003b2;-catenin as a direct miR-214 target, which suggests that miR-214 is an important regulator of Wnt signaling pathway activity in developing and postnatal skin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>miR-214 exhibits distinct expression patterns in the epidermis and HFs in developing and postnatal skin</title><p>To understand the role of miR-214 in the control of skin morphogenesis and HF cycling, miR-214 expression was examined in mouse back skin at different developmental stages, as well as during the first postnatal and depilation-induced hair cycles.

Similar fluctuations in the miR-214 levels were observed in adult skin during depilation-induced hair cycle: miR-214 expression progressively increased during HF transition from telogen to anagen and was maximal during the late anagen stage of the hair cycle (day 12 after depilation) followed by rapid decrease during catagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Spatiotemporal expression of miR-214 during HF morphogenesis and cycling.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) TaqMan real-time RT-PCR analysis of miR-214 expression.

Also, increased Loricrin protein expression was seen in the upper layers of the epidermis of the P6.5 DTG mice versus age-matched WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). Therefore, decreased epidermal thickness in miR-214 DTG mice could be developed because of the reduced keratinocyte proliferation and accelerated terminal differentiation in the epidermis.</p><p>Interestingly, miR-214 overexpression caused a lack of &#x0223c;30% of HFs in the back skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I and J</xref>). The number of induced HFs was significantly decreased in DTG mice at E15.5, E17.5, P0.5, and P8.5 compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I and J</xref>), which suggests that miR-214 overexpression alters the induction process in both primary and secondary HFs. The rate of HF development was not significantly different between DTG and WT mice; all HFs in DTG and WT mice reached the first anagen phase at P8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). However, all transgenic HFs at P8.5 showed significantly reduced length, which was accompanied by markedly reduced total skin thickness (Fig. S1, B and C). The hair bulb size and cell proliferation in the HF matrix were significantly reduced in all HFs of DTG mice versus the WT HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I and K&#x02013;M</xref>), whereas no apoptotic cells were detected in the HFs or interfollicular epidermis in DTG or WT mice (not depicted).

Therefore, the changes in visual coat appearance in DTG mice were most likely caused by the reduced number of the HFs, as well as by the decreased thickness of the hair shafts induced by miR-214 overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>Gain of miR-214 activity in postnatal skin alters HF cycling and HF size</title><p>To explore the effects of miR-214 on HF cycling, DTG mice were treated with Dox during telogen phase followed by the induction of the hair cycle by depilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

Consistent with this observation, Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of &#x003b2;-catenin in the keratinocytes cotreated with LiCl and miR-214 mimic compared with the cells treated with LiCl solo (Fig. S1 N).</p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin is a genuine target of miR-214, and that miR-214 is involved in the control of the activity of the Wnt pathway in keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of Wnt signaling rescues the skin phenotype in miR-214 transgenic mice</title><p>To further explore the functional links between miR-214 and &#x003b2;-catenin in vivo, miR-214 transgene was induced after E10.5, followed by the subcutaneous injections of Wnt agonist BIO on five consecutive days after birth. Although &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA levels were low in the skin of DTG mice treated with BIO, &#x003b2;-catenin protein expression was quite similar in the HFs of DTG and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). This suggests that the reduced levels of the &#x003b2;-catenin transcript were most likely compensated by &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilization caused by the GSK-3 inhibition induced by BIO (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Meijer et al., 2003</xref>). Pharmacological experiments revealed that BIO treatment lead to induction of new HFs in DTG mice postnatally, which resulted in the appearance of the HFs at early stages of morphogenesis (stages 2&#x02013;3) in DTG mice followed by restoration of their total number, similar to the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C&#x02013;E</xref>). In addition, pharmacological Wnt activation resulted in a significant increase of the hair bulb diameter in the HFs at advanced stages (stages 6&#x02013;7) of morphogenesis in DTG mice, whereas no increase of the hair bulb size was seen in WT mice treated with BIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>). These observations demonstrate that activation of Wnt signaling in DTG mice rescues the effects of miR-214 overexpression in vivo, confirming further that miR-214 does indeed interfere with Wnt pathway activity in the developing and postnatal skin.</p><fig id="fig8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of Wnt signaling rescues the skin phenotype in miR-214 transgenic mice.</bold> (A) Real-time RT-PCR.

In this paper, we identify a novel role for miR-214 in the control of skin and HF development, and demonstrate that: (1) miR-214 shows spatial-temporal changes in the expression pattern in the skin during HF morphogenesis and cycling; (2) inducible overexpression of miR-214 in keratinocytes inhibits cell proliferation, and results in a formation of fewer HFs with decreased size of the hair bulb, which produce thinner hair; (3) miR-214 regulates the balance in the activities of multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt, Shh, Edar, and Bmp, in developing and postnatal skin; and (4) &#x003b2;-catenin serves as a direct miR-214 target in keratinocytes.</p><p>During skin development and postnatal growth, miR-214 expression predominates in differentiating populations of keratinocytes committed either to epidermal or HF cell fates (suprabasal epidermal or hair matrix keratinocytes, respectively), whereas its expression in the progenitor cell populations of the basal epidermal layer or HF outer root sheath appears to be considerably lower. K14-driven miR-214 overexpression in the progenitor cell populations of the epidermis and HF results in a reduced epidermal proliferation and accelerated differentiation, as well as in formation of &#x0223c;30% fewer HFs with decreased hair bulb size and producing thinner hairs.</p><p>Skin and HF morphogenesis is controlled by coordinated activities of the Wnt, Hedgehog, Edar, Bmp, Fgf, Notch, and other signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Millar, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>). Among these pathways, Wnt signaling operates as the most powerful regulator of skin development. It controls cell proliferation in both epithelium (epidermis, HF matrix) and mesenchyme, and regulates differentiation of hair matrix keratinocytes and the morphogen-producing activity of dermal papilla cells (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Andl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Hsu, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). In the developing HFs, the Wnt signaling pathway operates as the activator of the placode formation, whereas BMP signaling inhibits this process and, together with Wnt inhibitors, Dkk1/2/4 promotes the interplacode cell fate in the epidermal progenitor cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Botchkarev et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Andl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Sick et al., 2006</xref>). In turn, FGF and Edar pathways promote the placode cell fate, at least in part, by inhibiting the activity of BMP signaling (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Eivers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Plouhinec et al., 2011</xref>), whereas Edar via the NF-kB pathway stimulates expression of the BMP antagonists, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and Follistatin (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Mou et al., 2006</xref>). Edar serves as a downstream effector of Wnt signaling, which is initially activated in preplacodes independently of Edar/NF-&#x003ba;B activity, whereas later Edar signaling is required to refine the pattern of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin activity via stimulation of expression of the Wnt10b in the placode progenitor cells (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, Edar signaling promotes HF placode formation by stimulation of Sonic hedgehog expression (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Pummila et al., 2007</xref>), which operates as a potent stimulator of keratinocyte proliferation in the developing HF (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Recent data suggest that the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway varies considerably in distinct skin compartments: low levels of activity are required for maintenance of epidermal proliferation, medium level signaling is required for maintenance of epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions in the hair bulb to promote active hair growth phase, and high activity promotes hair shaft differentiation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Our data demonstrate that miR-214 contributes to the regulation of the activity of Wnt signaling in the developing and postnatal skin, at least in part, by targeting its key component &#x003b2;-catenin: (1) miR-214 and &#x003b2;-catenin exhibit reciprocal expression pattern in the epidermis, whereas miR-214 and &#x003b2;-catenin are colocalized in undifferentiated epithelial cells of the hair peg and in hair matrix keratinocytes; (2) &#x003b2;-catenin expression is markedly decreased in the epidermis, HF placodes, HF matrix, and dermal papilla after K14-driven miR-214 overexpression; (3) bioinformatic prediction analysis and experimental data confirms direct targeting of <italic>&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR by miR-214 in keratinocytes; and (4) miR-214 is capable of interfering with the activity of Wnt signaling after its activation by the GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Furthermore, the skin phenotype of miR-214 transgenic mice (decreased epidermal proliferation, proportional decrease in the number of all HF types, decrease of the size of hair bulbs, and formation of thinner hair versus the corresponding WT controls) is consistent with the skin phenotype of mice with conditional ablation of &#x003b2;-catenin either in keratinocytes or in the dermal papilla fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the key features of the skin phenotype in miR-214&#x02013;overexpressing mice (decrease of the HF number and hair bulb size) are rescued by pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway in vivo, thus further supporting the links between miR-214 and Wnt pathway activity in the skin. These data are also consistent with data published previously showing miR-214 targeting of &#x003b2;-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Wnt signaling pathway is a potent regulator of cell proliferation, and many effects of miR-214 on skin and HF development are most likely associated with interference with cell cycle regulation: indeed, short-term activation of miR-214 (48 h) suppressed the expressions of several cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, including <italic>cyclin B</italic>, <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, <italic>cyclin D2</italic>, and <italic>cdk1</italic>. Consistent with these observations, substantial up-regulation in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and p19 was still detected in fully developed follicles of the K14rtTA/TRE-miR-214 mice, which suggests the activation of the anti-proliferative program in response to increased levels of miR-214 in the keratinocytes. These data are in line with the results obtained in other models demonstrating that miR-214 expression is substantially decreased in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Yamane et al., 2013</xref>) and that the anti-proliferative effects of miR-214 in the myoblast cell line are achieved by targeting Nras (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Reduced cell proliferation seen in the epidermis and HFs in K14rtTA/TRE-miR-214 mice could also be a result of altered activity of Shh signaling. Indeed, K14rtTA/TRE-miR-214 mice showed decreased expression of Shh and its signal tranducer Smo. Shh signaling is required for post-hair placode initiation growth by stimulating proliferation of HF epithelial cells via transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Mill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 2006</xref>). Shh also promotes epidermal proliferation (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). In adult mice, Shh is essential for anagen onset and proper hair cycling (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). However, our experimental data validating the bioinformatic prediction suggested that <italic>Shh</italic> does not serve as a direct miR-214 target in the keratinocytes. Given that Wnt signaling operates as upstream of Edar and Shh pathways in the control of the HF placode formation (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), these data suggest that down-regulation of Edar and Shh expression seen in the HF placodes of miR-214 DTG mice is, most likely, a result of the indirect effects linked to the miR-214&#x02013;mediated decrease of Wnt signaling activity in keratinocytes.</p><p>Our data demonstrating that overexpression of miR-214 results in the development of smaller HFs producing thinner hair suggest miR-214 involvement in the control of HF size and its relevance to the mechanisms that contribute to HF miniaturization seen in androgenetic alopecia (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Garza et al., 2011</xref>). However, additional studies are required to assess the role of miR-214 in the control of HF size in human skin, as well as the potential involvement of miR-214 in regulation of the activity of distinct HF stem cell populations residing in secondary hair germ and bulge during hair cycle (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rompolas and Greco, 2014</xref>). Our data suggest that the decrease of HF size in K14rtTA/TRE-miR-214 mice could not only be associated with the decreased proliferation in the hair matrix, but also with miR-214 effects on the migration of the progenitor cells from the bulge alongside the outer root sheath toward the hair matrix.</p><p>Indeed, K14rtTA/miR-214 HFs contained significantly fewer Sox9+ cells in the outer root sheath. Sox9 is a transcriptional regulator that is expressed in the HF stem cells and their outer root sheath progenies, and is required for guiding stem cell progenies to the hair matrix (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Vidal et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, a reduced number of Sox9+ cells in the transgenic follicles suggests the inhibitory action of miR-214 on stem cells and their progenies, which contributes to the formation of the smaller hair bulbs. However, these effects could also be associated with decreased &#x003b2;-catenin expression, as &#x003b2;-catenin is acting as the upstream regulator of Sox9 expression in the intestinal epithelium and neural crest cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blache et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the changes seen in the HF epithelium, a significant reduction in the number of dermal papilla cells was observed in K14rtTA/miR-214 mice. This is consistent with previously published data demonstrating that a decrease of the hair bulb size is associated with reduced cellularity of the dermal papilla (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chi et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to mice with conditional ablation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the HF mesenchyme (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2010</xref>), miR-214 overexpression results in the decrease of &#x003b2;-catenin, Lef1 expression, and lack of changes in Sox2 in the dermal papilla. Therefore, the effects seen in K14rtTA/miR-214 mice could be a result of the altered epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions. Also, given that miRNAs are capable of exerting paracrine effects on distantly located cellular targets (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Fan, 2011</xref>), additional studies are required to clarify whether miR-214 overexpression in keratinocytes could directly influence cell number and gene expression in dermal papilla fibroblasts, or if other paracrine factors released from keratinocytes affect traffic of the connective tissue progenitor cells to populate dermal papilla and/or their activity in the HFs in K14rtTA/miR-214 mice.</p><p>Additional studies are also required to define the upstream regulators that control miR-214 expression in the different cell types in the skin. For example, it has previously been shown that Twist1 transcriptionally regulates miR-214 expression in specific neural cell populations (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>); however, a role of Twist1 in skin development and HF cycling remains unknown and needs to be carefully explored. Identification of the miR-214 upstream regulators in skin will help to recognize novel players in the miRNA-mediated gene regulatory circuits controlling keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in the developing and postnatal skin.</p><p>In summary, our data reveal that miR-214 is a key determinant that controls the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway and &#x003b2;-catenin expression in the developing and postnatal skin and HFs. Because Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in the control of stem cell activity in many organs during development and regeneration, while its uncontrolled activation results in tumorigenesis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Malanchi et al., 2008</xref>), these data provide an important foundation for further analyses of the role of miR-214 as a regulator of Wnt pathway activity in many areas of research, including stem cell and cancer biology, regenerative medicine, and aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of transgenic mice</title><p>Animal studies were performed under protocols approved by Boston University and Home Office Project License (UK).
