The assembly of invadopodia is initiated in response to the focal generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate and the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, which recruits adaptor protein TKS5 and cortactin to initiate assembly of the actin core of invadopodium (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Seals et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Artym et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Oser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi and Oikawa, 2010</xref>). Upon maturation, invadopodia recruit and secrete proteinases such as membrane type 1 (MT1)&#x02013;matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), MMP2, and MMP9 to degrade ECM and facilitate invasion (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Artym et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Weaver, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Oser et al., 2009</xref>). Signaling molecules downstream of the ubiquitous secondary messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup> have been previously implicated in invadopodium regulation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baldassarre et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cortesio et al., 2008</xref>). However, the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in invadopodium modulation is not known.</p><p>Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry mechanism regulated by extracellular stimuli (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Putney, 1986</xref>). SOCE is induced in response to the activation of plasma membrane receptors and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>). Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 oligomerizes and translocates to the junction between plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum to activate the plasma membrane pore-forming unit Orai1, which induces SOCE (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Roos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Vig et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that store-operated calcium channel proteins STIM1 and Orai1 were critical for breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), and there was accumulating evidence suggesting that hyperactive SOCE promotes cancer progression (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Fedida-Metula et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chant&#x000f4;me et al., 2013</xref>).

However, it remains unclear how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are organized, spatially or temporally, to mobilize cancer invasion machinery and to promote metastasis.</p><p>Here, we examine the hypothesis that dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cancer cells promote invasion through focalized proteolysis and ECM remodeling. We unexpectedly discovered that STIM1- and Orai1-mediated SOCE in melanoma cells was organized in the form of persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and regulated both the assembly and activity of invadopodium. Our findings bring insight into spatiotemporal organization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during cancer invasion and metastasis and shed new light on the role of dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cancer malignancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for invadopodium formation and ECM degradation</title><p>When plated on gelatin-coated coverslips, WM793 human melanoma cells assembled invadopodia within 4 h (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). To investigate the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in invadopodium regulation, WM793 cells were treated with the membrane-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM. Buffering of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> remarkably reduced the number of invadopodia in WM793 cells and focalized gelatin degradation, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were a critical regulator of invadopodium formation and function (Fig. S1 C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Similar inhibition of invadopodium formation and activity was observed when the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was buffered with 0.5 mM EGTA (Fig. S1 C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Treatment with nifedipine (L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker), APV (NMDA blocker), and CNQX (AMPA receptor blocker) had no noticeable effects on invadopodium number or gelatin degradation (Fig. S1 C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). In contrast, the SOCE inhibitor 2-APB significantly decreased invadopodium number in WM793 cells and almost abolished focalized proteolysis by WM793 cells (Fig. S1 C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The importance of SOCE in the modulation of invadopodium formation and ECM degradation was further confirmed by using a different SOCE blocker (SKF96365) in CHL-1 and WM245 melanoma cell lines (Fig. S1, D&#x02013;G). Collectively, these data implied that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by SOCE channels is a critical regulator of invadopodium formation and ECM degradation.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>STIM1 and Orai1 are crucial for invadopodium formation and activity.</bold> (A and B) Scattered dot plot showing the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators and Ca<sup>2+</sup> blockers on invadopodium number per cell (A) and gelatin degradation area per cell (B).

The inhibition of SOCE in WM793 cells by STIM1 and Orai1 shRNA was confirmed with the use of a Fluo4-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> assay (Fig. S1 H). We next investigated the effects of STIM1 and Orai1 depletion on invadopodium formation and ECM degradation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (C and D)</xref>, Orai1 shRNA and STIM1 shRNA treatment resulted in &#x0223c;40&#x02013;50% reduction in the mean number of invadopodia per cell when compared with control shRNA cells. Moreover, the area of gelatin degradation per cell was inhibited by 70&#x02013;80% when STIM1 and Orai1 were depleted (Fig. S1 I).</p><p>We noted that the inhibitory effects of SOCE blockade, by shRNA or by pharmacological inhibitors, were more robust on gelatin degradation than on invadopodium number. The invadopodia in Orai1 shRNA cells had shallower degradation of ECM when compared with control cells, as revealed by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), implicating lower proteolysis activity for these invadopodia. To evaluate the effect of STIM1 and Orai1 on invadopodium activity, we use a new quantification method, invadopodium degradation index (IDX), to measure activity of each individual invadopodium. WM793 cells were allowed to attach to gelatin-coated coverslips in the presence of broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 for 12 h. The gelatin degradation activity of invadopodia was inhibited in the presence of GM6001. The degradation of Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled gelatin was initiated by washing away GM6001. After 4-h degradation, the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodia was determined through quantifying IDX, which corresponds to total gelatin degraded by individual invadopodia in a given period of time. The mean degradation activity of individual invadopodium was inhibited by &#x0223c;50% when STIM1 or Orai1 was depleted by shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>), as a result of decreases in both degradation area and &#x00394; intensity per invadopodium (Fig. S1, J and K).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether activation of SOCE in malignant cancer cells was sufficient to promote ECM degradation. The ectopic expression of STIM1, but not Orai1, has been previously shown to promote SOCE (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Soboloff et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (H&#x02013;J)</xref>, ectopic STIM1 expression increased the number of invadopodia per cell and enhanced the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodium. The stimulation of invadopodium formation by STIM1 was abrogated by SOCE blocker 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Collectively, these data indicated that STIM1 and Orai1 regulated invadopodium formation as well as the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodium.</p></sec><sec><title>SOCE mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation to regulate the assembly of invadopodial precursor</title><p>Invadopodia are assembled as actin-rich invadopodial precursors, which recruit MT1-MMP upon maturation to degrade ECM (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Artym et al., 2006</xref>). When stimulated with 10% FBS, serum-starved WM793 cells started assembling invadopodial precursor 10&#x02013;15-min after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Intriguingly, serum treatment also stimulated immediate but transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the form of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp2">Video 1</ext-link>). Buffering extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA didn&#x02019;t affect the transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but almost eliminated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp3">Video 2</ext-link>). Importantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation was restored after adding back Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the extracellular medium, strongly suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was crucial for Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp4">Video 3</ext-link>). To determine whether SOCE was responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation, we also examined the effects of SKF96365 on serum-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in WM793 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp5">Video 4</ext-link>). EGTA buffering and SOCE blockade with SKF96365 significantly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation frequencies from 18.6 &#x000b1; 1.4/h to 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.1/h and 7.2 &#x000b1; 0.4/h, respectively, suggesting that SOCE was a major mediator of serum-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). We further determine the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in the assembly of invadopodial precursor through live cell imaging and fluorescent staining on fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp6">Videos 5&#x02013;7</ext-link>). Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations with EGTA or SKF96365 remarkably decreased the numbers of invadopodia precursor assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). To further critically evaluate the role of SOCE in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation and invadopodia precursor assembly, we used shRNAs to knockdown STIM1 and Orai1 in WM793 cells. As expected, STIM1 and Orai1 shRNA significantly decreased the frequency of calcium oscillation when compared with control shRNA-expressing cells (P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I&#x02013;K</xref>). Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation with STIM1 or Orai1 shRNA also decreased the number of serum-stimulated invadopodial precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 L</xref>). Collectively, our data suggested that SOCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are critical for assembly of invadopodial precursors.</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SOCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations regulate invadopodial precursor assembly.</bold> (A) WM793 cells were starved overnight, and invadopodial (Invado.) precursor assembly were initiated by stimulation with 10% FBS.

SOCE blockade with 2-APB or STIM1 and Orai1 double knockdown had no noticeable effect on total protein levels of MT1-MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). However, surprisingly, SOCE blockade reduced the plasma membrane fraction of MT1-MMP (biotinylated MT1-MMP) by 50&#x02013;70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>), suggesting that SOCE regulates invadopodium activity mainly through the subcellular localization of MT1-MMP. Indeed, when stably expressed in WM793 cells, MT1-MMP&#x02013;EGFP localized to the plasma membrane and perinuclear compartments in the vicinity of trans-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Strikingly, after 2-APB treatment for 2.5 h, MT1-MMP&#x02013;EGFP signals were drastically reduced in the plasma membrane and increased in the perinuclear region, suggesting the translocation of plasma membrane MT1-MMP to intracellular compartments that are reminiscent of endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201407082/DC1" id="supp9">Video 8</ext-link>).</p><p>To investigate whether MT1-MMP was trapped in the endocytic compartment after SOCE blockade, we used mRFP-Rab5 and confocal microscopy to visualize endosomes in WM793 cells.

To understand how SOCE regulates the subcellular localization of MT1-MMP, we next examined the effect of SOCE blockade on MT1-MMP endocytosis. The biotinylated MT1-MMP was endocytosed at essentially the same rate in SOCE inhibitor-treated cells as in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>), suggesting that the accumulation of MT1-MMP in the endocytic compartment might be caused by defective recycling back to the plasma membrane. To examine this possibility, biotinylated MT1-MMP were allowed to be endocytosed, and the remaining biotinylation on the plasma membrane MT1-MMP was removed with 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). MESNA treatment before endocytosis completely removed biotinylation on MT1-MMP, confirming the efficacy of this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>, lane 1). After 30-min endocytosis at 37&#x000b0;C, MESNA was able to only partially remove biotin, suggesting endocytosis of plasma membrane MT1-MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). The biotinylated MT1-MMP in the endocytic compartment were then allowed to be recycled back to the plasma membrane in the presence of SOCE blocker or vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;7). After 60-min (or 30 min) recycling, there were &#x0223c;20% (or 30%) of biotinylated MT1-MMP retained in the intracellular compartments of the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, when SOCE was blocked with 2-APB, &#x0003e;40% (or 50%) of biotinylated MT1-MMP remained intracellular after a 60-min (or 30 min) recycling, indicating inhibition of MT1-MMP recycling by SOCE blockade. Collectively, our data suggest that SOCE blockade entraps MT1-MMP in the endocytic compartment through interfering with its recycling to the plasma membrane, which inhibits the ECM degradation activity of invadopodia.</p></sec><sec><title>SOCE is critical for melanoma metastasis</title><p>Gaining invasiveness is one of the first and most critical steps of metastasis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Fidler, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">N&#x000fc;rnberg et al., 2011</xref>).

Using a novel image quantification method, we were able to demonstrate that SOCE regulates the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodium. Surprisingly, SOCE regulates invadopodium activity not through the total protein levels of MT1-MMP or secreted soluble MMPs but through the subcellular localization of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane MT1-MMP is believed to be recruited to invadopodia through incorporation of MT1-MMP&#x02013;containing vesicles at the ECM degradation sites (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Steffen et al., 2008</xref>). Although SOCE blockade did not affect MT1-MMP endocytosis, it did dramatically reduce the recycling of endocytosed MT1-MMP back to the plasma membrane, which results in the entrapment of MT1-MMP in Rab5-positive endosomes. SOCE was previously reported to be required for the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in mast cells and natural killer cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Maul-Pavicic et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that SOCE blockade decreased the membrane expression of MT1-MMP by inhibiting the plasma membrane insertion of MT1-MMP vesicles. It is also worth noting the SOCE regulation of exocytosis appeared to be selective, as the exocytosis of the soluble MMP2 was only very modestly inhibited by SOCE blockade.</p><p>Unexpectedly, SOCE signals in melanoma cells were temporally organized in the form of persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. It was proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations might serve as a mode of digital signaling that dictates the specificity and robustness of downstream signaling cascades through oscillation frequency and amplitude (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bird et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>). For any supralinear calcium-dependent process, the time-averaged effect of an oscillatory calcium signal is always greater than the effect of a steady calcium signal of the same net strength. For example, certain threshold-dependent phenomena can be selectively activated in an oscillation frequency-dependent manner. Moreover, because constitutive increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is deleterious and may lead to cell death (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Orrenius et al., 2003</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations provide the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals necessary for invadopodia formation and activity without causing cytotoxicity. It is also conceivable that invadopodia formation and function require coordinated cycles of high and low calcium signals provided by oscillation, as recently demonstrated in the case of mast cell exocytosis (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wollman and Meyer, 2012</xref>). Although constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was effective in the activation of Src, it inhibited invadopodia formation and melanoma invasion. This is consistent with the notion that temporal oscillation is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to coordinate invasion and ECM degradation. The SOCE activated by repetitive discharge of store Ca<sup>2+</sup> during oscillation also creates subplasmalemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains to regulate enzyme activity and gene transcription (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Capite et al., 2009</xref>). Future effort to determine spatial and temporal organization of subplasmalemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains during melanoma invasion and ECM remodeling is warranted.</p><p>Invasion is a critical step during melanoma progression. The prognosis of melanoma patients significantly worsens with deeper levels of invasion, after melanoma breaches the basement membrane separating epidermis from dermis and progresses from radial growth phase to vertical growth phase (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Clark, 1991</xref>). Our data suggested that SOCE was hyperactivated during melanoma progression, with STIM1 expression increased in malignant melanomas when compared with benign nevi. The overexpression of STIM1 and hyperactivation of SOCE in melanoma likely promoted melanoma invasion and metastasis. Indeed, when STIM1 was knocked down in 1205Lu cells, the lung metastasis of this highly metastatic melanoma cell was dramatically reduced. Our data, together with recently reported findings in breast and cervical cancer (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chant&#x000f4;me et al., 2013</xref>), suggested that hyperactive SOCE pathways in various cancer might be targeted to inhibit metastasis and progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>We used the following antibodies in this study: STIM1 antibody for immunohistochemistry (MA1-19451; Thermo Fisher Scientific), STIM1 antibody for Western blotting (mouse monoclonal; 610954; BD), Orai1 (rabbit polyclonal; O8264; Sigma-Aldrich), GAPDH (mouse monoclonal; G8795; Sigma-Aldrich), Src (mouse monoclonal; clone GD11 05-184; EMD Millipore), p-Src (Tyr416) (rabbit polyclonal; 2101; Cell Signaling Technology), Akt (mouse monoclonal; 2966; Cell Signaling Technology), p-AKT (Ser473) (rabbit monoclonal; 193H12; Cell Signaling Technology), FAK (rabbit polyclonal; 3285; Cell Signaling Technology), p-FAK (Tyr397) (rabbit polyclonal; 3283; Cell Signaling Technology), Tubulin (mouse monoclonal; T6199; Sigma-Aldrich), cortactin (mouse monoclonal; clone 4F11 05-180; EMD Millipore), and p230 trans-Golgi (mouse monoclonal; 611281; BD).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The cell culture media used were RPMI 1640 (for all melanoma cells) and DMEM (for MCF-7 and NMuMG).

Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl ester (Invitrogen), or Texas red-X succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml. Dye solution (50 &#x000b5;l) was added slowly to 1 ml of bovine skin gelatin solution (Sigma-Aldrich; 40 mg/ml; dissolved in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, at pH 8.3 for succinimidyl ester or pH 9.0 for tetrafluorophenyl ester) while vortexing. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the free dyes in the mixture were removed with a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare). The desalted fluorescent gelatin solution can be stored at 4&#x000b0;C for short-term storage or at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C with 10% glycerol as a cryoprotectant for long-term storage.</p></sec><sec><title>Invadopodia activity assay</title><p>The invadopodia activity assay protocol was adapted from a previous protocol (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Artym et al., 2006</xref>) with modifications (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>) by plating cancer cells onto glass coverslips coated with a thin film of fluorescent gelatin. To coat the coverslips with fluorescent gelatin, acid-washed glass coverslips were incubated with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine for 20 min, washed with PBS, and cross-linked with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min. After extensive wash with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with diluted fluorescent gelatin (mixing 0.2% unlabeled bovine skin gelatin solution with fluorescent gelatin at 8:1 ratio) for 10 min.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators and channel blockers and other inhibitors or control vehicle were added at indicated concentrations to the growth medium and incubated for another 2 h. Cells were fixed 4 h after plating with 4% paraformaldehyde. Alternatively, melanoma cells in growth medium were allowed to attach to fluorescent gelatin coverslips in the presence of broad spectrum inhibitor GM6001 (10 &#x000b5;M) for 12 h. In the presence of GM6001, no gelatin degradation was detected. To initiate focalized proteolysis of gelatin, melanoma cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with RPMI 1640 growth medium containing control vector or appropriate inhibitors, blockers, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators in a 37&#x000b0;C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 4 h before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed melanoma cells were then permeabilized in antibody diluting buffer (2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594&#x02013; or Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled phalloidin (1:100 dilution from a 20-U/ml stock solution) for 30 min. Extensive washes with PBS were performed after each step. The coverslips were then mounted onto slides in mounting medium (150 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 90% glycerol).

We quantified 20&#x02013;30 cells from five random 63&#x000d7; fields.

Mean fluorescence intensity in a no-degradation reference area (<italic>F<sub>r</sub></italic>) in the vicinity was also measured. IDX of each invadopodium was calculated according to the following equation: IDX = (1 &#x02212; <italic>F<sub>i</sub>/F<sub>r</sub></italic>) &#x000d7; <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>. IDX is proportional to the total amount of gelatin degraded by individual invadopodium and is comparable between different coverslips assuming similar gelatin coating thickness.
