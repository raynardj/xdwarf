while driving on lower extremity muscle activation. [Subjects] The subjects of this
experimental study were 14 healthy women in their 20s who normally wear shoes with high
heels. [Methods] The subjects were asked to place their shoes on an accelerator pedal with
the heel touching the floor and then asked to press the pedal with as much pressure as
possible for 3 seconds before removing their feet from the pedal. A total of 3
measurements were taken for each heel height (flat, 5&#x02005;cm, 7&#x02005;cm), and the heel height was
randomly selected. [Results] The levels of muscle activity, indicated as the percentage of
reference voluntary contraction, for gastrocnemius muscle in the flat, 5&#x02005;cm, and 7&#x02005;cm
shoes were 180.8&#x000b1;61.8%, 285.4&#x000b1;122.3%, and 366.2&#x000b1;193.7%, respectively, and there were
significant differences between groups. Those for the soleus muscle were 477.3&#x000b1;209.2%,
718.8&#x000b1;380.5%, and 882.4&#x000b1;509.9%, and there were significant differences between groups.
[Conclusion] To summarize the results of this study, it was found that female drivers
require greater lower extremity muscle activation when wearing high heels than when
wearing low heels. Furthermore, instability and muscle fatigue of the ankle joint, which
results from wearing high heels on a daily basis, could also occur while driving.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>High heel</kwd><kwd>Muscle activation</kwd><kwd>Car accelerator pedal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shoes can be selected on the basis of mobility and functionality, but more emphasis has
been placed in recent times on the aesthetic appeal of footwear. Many women wear high heels
of various shapes and live their daily lives while wearing high heels<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A total of 59% of females wear high heels eight hours a
day<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this puts many women in a
position of having to make difficult choices between balancing fashion and comfort when
selecting their shoes. Wearing high heels is related to a deterioration in body alignment,
and it can lead to ankle instability by changing the static and dynamic body alignment
characteristics. The increase in muscle activity of the plantar flexor resulting from
wearing very high heels can reduce stability due to muscle imbalances of the feet and ankle
joints. It can also decrease one&#x02019;s ability to respond to unexpected resistance by increasing
muscle fatigue and decreasing the muscle control ability of the ankle joint<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Driving posture is an important element to be considered in the ergonomic design of cars.
When designing and manufacturing cars, in order to provide maximum comfort and safety, the
complex biomechanical elements of the human musculoskeletal system are taken into
consideration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pressing of the
accelerator and brake pedals, which are important elements of car control, can be restricted
by the user&#x02019;s shoes<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, wearing
high heels, while driving, can cause discomfort when operating the pedals and could also
prove to be hazardous.</p><p>The majority of previous studies associated with high heels have focused on variables
related to gait<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas most of the studies on the relationship between cars and
humans have considered the designs of seating positions that offer optimal comfort<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> regardless of footwear. However, when one
considers the amount of time that modern women spend in cars, studies that have dealt with
the effects of wearing high heels while pressing on pedals have been lacking. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to determine the effects of wearing high heels while driving on
lower extremity muscle activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this experimental study were 14 healthy women in their 20s who wear shoes
with high heels more than three times a week. Their average age, weight, and height were
23.78 &#x000b1; 3.22&#x02005;years, 59.02 &#x000b1; 7.88&#x02005;kg, and 162.65&#x000b1;5.29&#x02005;cm, respectively. None of the subjects
had experienced any pathologic symptoms in the feet and legs for the last 6 months, and none
had any history of operation on the lower extremities. Further, they also had no history of
neurological disease. Before taking part, all of the participants were thoroughly briefed
about the experimental procedures and asked to read and sign a consent form.</p><p>The subjects were then asked to select their shoe sizes, 23.0&#x02005;cm, 23.5&#x02005;cm, or 24.0&#x02005;cm for
identical high-heeled shoes of two different heights (5&#x02005;cm and 7&#x02005;cm) and flat shoes of
sizes, which had been prepared for this experiment. In order to measure the lower extremity
muscle activation occurring while pressing a pedal when wearing high heels, the subjects
were asked to sit in the driver&#x02019;s seat of a car (Elantra HD, Hyundai Motor Company, South
Korea). They were then allowed to adjust the seat-back angles and the pedal-to-seat distance
so that they were able to operate the accelerator pedal with ease. The subjects, after
finding comfortable driving positions, were asked to place the appropriate shoes on the
accelerator pedal with the heel touching the floor and then asked to press the pedal with as
much pressure as possible for 3 seconds before removing their feet from the pedal. A total
of 3 measurements were taken for each heel height, and the heel height was randomly
selected. In order to avoid muscle fatigue, the participants were given a short rest of 30
seconds after each measurement. Electromyographic (EMG) measurements were taken from the
moment the pedal was pressed to the moment when the pedal was released.</p><p>To measure the lower extremity muscle activation, electrodes were attached to the rectus
femoris, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus were selected. Electrodes were also
attached to the right leg.</p><p>ProComp Infiniti<sup>TM</sup> (Thought Technology Ltd., Montreal, QC, Canada) was employed
for measurement of the muscle activation of each muscle. A surface electrode (Triode surface
electrode, Thought Technology Ltd., Montreal, QC, Canada) consisting of a tripolar electrode
(positive-ground-negative) was used. The frequency range of the electromyogram signals was
set to 20 to 500&#x02005;Hz, and the sampling frequency was set to 1,024&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>The root mean square of each muscle was measured for five seconds while the subjects sat in
the driver&#x02019;s seat. The relative muscle contraction was calculated referring to 100% of the
mean electromyogram signal measured for the three seconds in the middle, excluding the data
of the first one second and the last one second, and expressed as the muscle activation in
terams of the percentage of reference voluntary contraction (%RVC) for one instance of
pushing the accelerator.</p><p>PASW for Windows (Ver. 19) was used for data analysis. In order to determine the difference
between wearing high heels and low heels, one-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA) was
carried out, and Tukey&#x02019;s test was used as a post hoc test to verify differences. The level
of significance was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The levels of muscle activity for the gastrocnemius muscle in the flat, 5&#x02005;cm, and 7&#x02005;cm

when high heels are worn greatly affects the stability of the ankle joint by increasing the
plantar flexion of the ankle joint and readily inducing muscle fatigue<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most of the previous studies have looked into the gait
resulting from the change in the body&#x02019;s center of gravity when wearing high heels and the
kinetic and kinematic properties that are required to maintain balance while standing<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, in this study, the intention was to determine the effects of wearing high heels
while in a sitting position, that is, when the majority of the body&#x02019;s center of gravity is
supported by all the muscles of the trunk.</p><p>Plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle joint are the movements associated with
pressing the accelerator and releasing the accelerator of a car. The results of the present
study showed that with an increase in heel height, the muscle activation increased in the
gastrocnemius and soleus ankle joint plantar flexion agonists, especially with a heel height
of 7&#x02005;cm, which resulted in a statistically significant increase in muscle activation.
Despite statistically insignificant data, it was found that as the heel height increased,
the tibialis anterior muscle activation of ankle joint dorsiflexion agonist have also
increased. This appeared to be the result of an increased plantar flexion angle resulting
from the increase in heel height: the movement of pressing the accelerator pedal results in
ankle joint plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. In addition, although not a statistically
significant increase, the muscle activation of the rectus femoris tended to increase with an
increase in heel height, and this was the result of an increase in knee joint extension.
This concurs with the results of a previous study, which found that the proximal part
required preceding contraction due to the instability of the distal part in the ankle joint
with an increase in heel height<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To summarize the results of this study, it was found that female drivers require greater
lower extremity muscle activation when wearing high heels than when wearing low heels.
Furthermore, the instability and muscle fatigue of the ankle joint, which result from
wearing high heels on a daily basis, can also occur while driving.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Chenier</surname><given-names>TC</given-names></name><name><surname>Brauninger</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of positive heel inclination on
