For this reason, we studied the protective action of two biogenic polyamines (PAs) spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) on PSI activity in isolated thylakoid membranes subjected to photoinhibition. Our results show that pre-loading thylakoid membranes with Spm and Spd reduced considerably the inhibition of O<sub>2</sub> uptake rates, P700 photooxidation and the accumulation of superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) induced by light stress. Spm seems to be more effective than Spd in preserving PSI photo-stability. The correlation of the extent of PSI protection, photosystem II (PSII) inhibition and O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> generation with increasing Spm doses revealed that PSI photo-protection is assumed by two mechanisms depending on the PAs concentration. Given their antioxidant character, PAs scavenge directly the O<sub>2</sub>

However, for non-physiological concentration, the ability of PAs to protect PSI is due to their inhibitory effect on PSII electron transfer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca</ext-link>, RGPIN1502, RC.

In the photosynthetic process, thylakoid membranes which are composed mainly of 4 supra-molecular protein complexes: photosystem II (PSII), photosystem I (PSI), cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>/f (Cyt b<sub>6</sub>/f) and ATP synthase. These complexes are responsible for the photochemical transformation of light energy into chemical energy resulting into the production of NADPH and ATP possessing high reducing power. Excitation of PSII with light produces electrons, protons and oxygen <italic>via</italic> water oxidation. The electrons are transferred to PSI through the transporters of the thylakoid membranes to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup>. In addition, the protons are used by ATP synthase for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation <xref rid="pone.0112893-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. NADPH and ATP are then used to assimilate CO<sub>2</sub> for sugar production <italic>via</italic> Calvin-Benson cycle.</p><p>However, excess light may affect photosynthetic processes such as the rate of electron-transport, oxygen evolution, and ATP production <xref rid="pone.0112893-Quiles1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-Sonoike1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The damaging effect of light on photosynthetic activity is known as the photoinhibition process (PI). It is well established that the two photosystems may be targets for PI <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> under various environmental conditions. It was reported that PSI is more resistant at ambient temperature; the mechanism of this resistance is not yet well understood <xref rid="pone.0112893-Terashima1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although PSII is known to be more sensitive than PSI, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of PSI is more deleterious to plants. This is not only due to the slow rate of its recovery but also due to its involvement in PSII repair as PSI is thought to provide the proton gradient required for ATP synthesis <xref rid="pone.0112893-Danon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-Kudoh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>To avoid the strong damaging effects of light on photosynthetic membranes, plants have developed several protective mechanisms involving physical (alteration of leaf blade orientation), physiological (non-photochemical quenching) and biochemical changes (e.g, accumulation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants) <xref rid="pone.0112893-Govindachary2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-Havaux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-James1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, understanding these survival mechanisms presents a broad bearing on many fields including the development of photo-resistant plants. Nowadays, it is well known that oxidative stress constitutes the most important factor of the PI <xref rid="pone.0112893-Miyao1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-Sonoike2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. During this process, light, oxygen and electron transport induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) such as singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>.</sup>). These species are mainly generated in PSI, but their damaging effects were observed even at the PSII level <xref rid="pone.0112893-Tjus2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The oxidative stress may induce functional and/or structural modification of thylakoid membrane proteins to engender their damage <xref rid="pone.0112893-Tjus2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-Miyao1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-Yordanov1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-Aro1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The most important line of defense against the oxidative stress implicates the enzymatic antioxidant system called water-water cycle <xref rid="pone.0112893-Asada1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This cycle is composed of several reactions which scavenge O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It involves the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), two enzymes located in the stroma and in the acceptor side of PSI <xref rid="pone.0112893-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-Miyake2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, it has been observed that plants significantly increase the amount of various polyamines (PAs), such as spermine (Spm), spermidine (Spd) and putrescine (Put), under stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0112893-Ltz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-Nayyar1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For example, chilling temperatures can stimulate the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, an enzyme implicated in PAs synthesis. The enhancement of PAs levels under stressful conditions may decrease plant susceptibility to photoinhibition <xref rid="pone.0112893-He1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Biogenic PAs are produced in the chloroplast and occur under free or conjugated forms <xref rid="pone.0112893-Kotzabasis1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-DellaMea1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The conjugation of PAs is catalyzed by an enzyme named transglutaminase. This enzyme catalyses the incorporation of PAs into thylakoid and stromal proteins such as the light harvesting complex (LHC) and the large subunit of Rubisco <xref rid="pone.0112893-Asada1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-SobieszczukNowicka1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112893-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Recently, Hamdani et al. <xref rid="pone.0112893-Hamdani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> have investigated the beneficial role of some amines (Spm, Put and methylamine) as photo-protectors of PSII <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was found that only Spm showed photo-protective effect. This finding is considered important in understanding the mechanism of plant photo-adaptation in the presence of Spm. As PSI is also susceptible to photoinhibition under some conditions, it is reasonable to assume that PAs such as Spm could also exert a protective function against PSI photoinhibition. It is, therefore, of interest to determine the specific effect and to elucidate the photo-protective mechanism of these PAs.</p><p>The protective action of PAs against various stresses such as salt stress, UV-B radiation, ozone, heavy metal, or osmotic stress, is largely reported in the literature <xref rid="pone.0112893-Demetriou1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112893-Besford1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Most of these studies suggested that PAs protected plant cells <italic>via</italic> a direct interaction with their components or indirectly <italic>via</italic> its antioxidant role. However, the mechanism of their action is not yet fully understood. We provide here an insight on the mode of action of these PAs in protecting PSI activity in isolated thylakoid membranes. The measurements of electron transport, P700 photooxidation, and O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> accumulation have been carried out to assess the effect of two PAs, with different positive charges and carbon chain, namely Spm and Spd on thylakoid membranes subjected to high light intensities. The structure of the two PAs is presented below:</p><p>

The results allowed us to differentiate two phases with regard to inhibition of PSII activity. The first one is observed for doses below 1.5 mM where the PSII activity is not greatly affected while the PSI photo-protection readily increases. This effect of Spm on PSI activity may be ascribed to the O<sub>2</sub>

<sup>&#x02212;</sup> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112893-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The second phase is observed for the concentrations higher than 1.5 mM Spm and may be divided into two parts: (i) for doses between 1.5&#x02013;3 mM, the loss of PSII activity and the protection of P700 photooxidation increased, but the latter stayed more prominent than the PSII inactivation, (ii) for Spm doses higher than 3 mM, the inhibition of PSII electron transport and the protection of P700 photooxidation were closely similar. On the other hand, the protection of PSI activity measured as O<sub>2</sub> uptake rates also increased with the Spm added doses, but not to the same extent as P700 oxidation. These results suggest that Spm, depending in its concentration, can protect PSI against PI by two different mechanisms: scavenging O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and by regulating PSII electron transfer.</p><p>To better estimate the Spm concentration range for these mechanisms, we measured NBT photo-reduction to determine the O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> generated in the presence of different Spm doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112893-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The results show that the initial rate of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> production displayed a complex response depending on the concentration of Spm. When the doses of Spm were below 1 mM, a significant decrease in the rate of NBT reduction was observed. After that, the addition of 1.5&#x02013;2 mM Spm to the thylakoid preparation increased the rate of NBT reduction, but it did not surpass the control rate. Surprisingly, at Spm doses higher than 3 mM, the rate of NBT reduction decreased sharply and correlated well with PSII inhibition in dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112893-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This indicates that at these Spm concentrations the decrease of NBT reduction rate is due to the inhibition of electron transfer from PSII to PSI by Spm. It is likely, that the concentration of Spm in the range of 1.5&#x02013;2 mM constitutes a transient phase between its roles as antioxidant and as a regulator of PSII electron transfer.</p><p>To confirm the implication of decreasing PSII electron transfer in PSI photo-protection, we measured the O<sub>2</sub> uptake rates in DCMU treated thylakoid membranes.

Up to 2.5 mM, Spd induced a greater stimulation of PSII activity (20%) than Spm. It is known that PAs are associated with the components of the thylakoid membranes and are considered as regulators of the photosynthetic processes <xref rid="pone.0112893-Navakoudis1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

One plausible explanation for this stimulation is the interaction of added PAs with photosynthetic membranes lacking their associated PAs as by the extraction procedure. This interaction could allow the restoration of the appropriate protein structural organization for electron transfer. At 2.5 mM, the protection of P700 oxidation and O<sub>2</sub> uptake did not exceed 12% and 7% respectively. The inhibition of the electron transfer in PSII was observed only above 2.5 mM, and increased rapidly to reach maximum (95%) at 7 mM. However, the protection of P700 oxidation increased progressively with Spd concentration (85% at 7 mM). The response of the O<sub>2</sub> uptake rates to increasing Spd concentrations was less important than that of P700 oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112893-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) as for Spm. This is probably due to the sensitivity of some membrane-bound electron carriers to the higher dose of polyamines.

The interaction of PAs with thylakoid membranes is likely ensured by their polycationic nature. Despite that the two PAs presented a similar pattern in protecting PSI against PI, we observed that Spm is more effective than Spd. The little difference observed between the two PAs may be attributed to the difference in their chemical properties such as the number of their positive charges (four for Spm and three for Spd). This feature allows them to interact with the negatively charged stromal side of thylakoid membranes <xref rid="pone.0112893-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.

The inhibition of PSII activity observed with non-physiological doses of Spm or Spd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112893-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112893-g006">6A</xref>) was considered harmful when the activity of PSII was studied separately in isolated thylakoids or PSII sub-membrane fractions <xref rid="pone.0112893-Hamdani2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. But, <italic>in vivo</italic>, when PSII pumps electrons to the PSI complex under stress conditions, the importance of PSII deactivation must be taken into account. Especially, when the PSII repair and PAs biosynthesis are finely controlled and require PSI activity to fulfill the need for ATP. This point of view is important in the understanding of the importance of PSI resistance to photoinhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report in this study that exogenous application of Spm or Spd on thylakoid membranes resulted in the preservation of PSI activity against PI under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. The mechanisms of PSI photo-protection minimized the PI-induced oxidative stress. This is clearly due to a direct O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> scavenging by PAs at physiological concentration and/or due to the inhibition of electron transfer from PSII towards PSI at higher doses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112893.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
