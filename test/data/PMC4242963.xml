after returning to competition and psychological and behavioral variables during the
rehabilitation period. [Subjects] Athletes (N =113) that had experienced an injury (mean
age = 20.22&#x02005;years, SD = 1.07; mean weeks after stopping sports = 7.98 weeks, SD = 11.74)
participated in this study. [Methods] The subjects were asked to respond to the athletic
injury version of the Temporal Perspective Scale (TP-S), existing scales including the
DDF-S, AIPA-S, and ARD-S, and the outcome indices for rehabilitation. [Results] The
results of a cluster analysis indicated three modalities of temporal perspective (i.e.,
positive, neutral, and negative sequences). The results of an analysis of variance showed
that the positive chain modality was adaptive for future dominance. The subjects in this
group demonstrated higher levels of acceptance of injuries during the rehabilitation
period than the other groups, devotion to rehabilitation, and awareness of the recovery in
competitive performance and a feeling of personal growth. [Conclusion] The level of
acceptance of injury during the rehabilitation period, as well as the devotion to
rehabilitation, influenced adaptation after returning to competition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Adaptation after returning to competition</kwd><kwd>Temporal perspective</kwd><kwd>Athletic rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The authors of a previous study demonstrated a positive relationship between athletic
injury psychological acceptance (AIPA) and rehabilitation behaviors. They pointed out the
effectiveness of psychological support aimed at acceptance of an injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, to get a clear
view of appropriate goals and tasks to support injured athletes, it is essential to examine
their adaptive state after returning to competition instead of targeting short-term
intervention effects, such as psychological stress reduction and devotion to rehabilitation
behaviors. This is because some athletes worry about their competitive career not only
during rehabilitation after injury but also after returning to competition. Moreover, some
athletes cannot actively engage in competition<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. These athletes, at least, have difficulties
integrating their pre-injury selves (the past) into their present selves, which makes it
impossible for them to look into the future. Some may also persist in the injury and the
pre-injury self and still desire to maintain an internal connection with these points in
time. Therefore, recovery of the temporal perspective related to injury is a significant
index for predicting whether athletes, with high affinity for physical and athletic
abilities, can adapt psychologically, both during rehabilitation and after returning to
competition.</p><p>Since Frank<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, various definitions of
temporal perspective have been discussed. In this study, the perspective of the ribbon model
proposed by Katsumata<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> was used. He
reviewed previous studies on temporal perspective and pointed out the following issues:
ambiguity of the relationships between the past, the present, and the future; inclination to
the future perspective; and a delay in research on clinical psychology and psychopathology.
Therefore, he redefined temporal perspective as the &#x0201c;organically related integral of
perspectives (regarding the past, the present, and the future) held by an individual, a
group, or a society at one point during the passage of time (duration),&#x0201d; and he identified
three perspectives (i.e., the past, the present, and the future)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Attention should be given to his adaptive and maladaptive
temporal perspective models in which a psycho-cybernetics standpoint was incorporated to
explain the temporal perspective. For instance, the concepts of feedback (FB) and
feedforward (FF) were used to explain the past and the future perspectives, respectively.
This demonstrated that the way people hold a present perspective has a close relationship
with the other perspectives by means of FB and FF. In the adaptive temporal perspective
model, the three perspectives are integrated; a positive FB is given from the past
perspective, which is mediated by the present perspective, and then, the FF is given to the
future perspective. It was pointed out that this sequence always continues. On the other
hand, in the maladaptive temporal perspective model, the three perspectives are not
integrated. Only a negative FB is given from the past perspective, which stays at the
present perspective that is preoccupied with the negative present. It has been pointed out
that the present perspective has neither a future perspective nor negative FF to the future
perspective. This is in line with the studies of Erikson<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, who in his epigenetic
theory related to ego-identity described the importance of integrating an individual&#x02019;s past,
present, and future selves as the central issue of development during adolescence.
Katsumata<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> pointed out that a key aspect
of psychological intervention is to help athletes reconsider their negative perceptions
about their injuries (i.e., the past) and the future and perceive them more positively.
According to the psychoanalytic perspective, unsolved negative emotions in the past that are
present at the time of injury could cast a long shadow over the rest of the injured
athlete&#x02019;s life. Based on the mentioned above considerations, it seems reasonable to predict
the adaptive state of injured athletes after returning to competition by using the temporal
perspective FB-FF theory.</p><p>In this study, factors experienced during the rehabilitation period were examined, as they
can impact the state of adaptation after returning to competition. This will clarify the
perspective of psychological intervention for rehabilitation medical care. Based on previous
studies by the author of this study<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, we investigated the following factors:
AIPA and athletic rehabilitation dedication (ARD) as variables describing psychological and
behavioral attitudes during the rehabilitation period and perception of personality
regarding the difficulty describing feelings (DDF) and perception of support including
listening and acceptance as variables generating individual differences in attitude,
emotional reactions, and coping behaviors.</p><p>Tatsumi<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> clarified two factors of AIPA,
the focus on the present and self-motivation, and confirmed the relationships among ARD,
vision about rehabilitation and the competitive career after returning to competition. Here,
the focus on the present is defined as the &#x0201c;feeling of compromise regarding the injury
event.&#x0201d; Self-motivation is defined as &#x0201c;consistent sense of purpose for rehabilitation
effort.&#x0201d; After injury, athletes develop problems maintaining a continuous sense of the self.
More specifically, the state of the temporal perspective after returning to competition
significantly relates to how much recovery was achieved for the sense of self-discontinuity
due to injury during the rehabilitation stage. Regarding this point, Fujii&#x02019;s<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> discussion on the &#x0201c;perception of the
continuity for successive athletic ability&#x0201d; is inspiring. He focused on how injured athletes
perceive the continuous relationship of their athletic ability with the past or the present.
&#x0201c;Negative cognition&#x0201d; is defined as the expectation that the level of athletic ability would
return to the state just prior to that at the time of injury and continue to develop from
there (i.e., seeking consecutiveness from the pre-injury state for athletic ability).
&#x0201c;Positive cognition&#x0201d; is defined as the expectation that the decreased athletic ability of
the present is connected to the future (i.e., perceiving a continuous relationship from the
present)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially, at the early
stages of rehabilitation, injured athletes may consciously or unconsciously persist in the
pre-injury self, and they tend to seek to place their athletic abilities on a continuum in
the pre-injury condition. However, they start to recognize that in reality they should
perceive their athletic ability from the present onward to be a continuation of the
post-injury state. Inconsistencies occur here both for athletic ability and the sense of
self-continuity. Unconscious conflicts consisting of both continuousness prospects form
grief reactions such as impatience and anger, as well as regret and remorse. This leads to
negative rehabilitation behaviors. Therefore, the task for injured athletes is to accept
their injuries, and connect the break of continuity to the rebound point (i.e., the
present). It can be considered that the aforementioned mentality of AIPA<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> contributes significantly to the changes in
perception of psychological time. The mentality of focusing on the present enables injured
athletes to break away from the self that seeks the perspective from the point of injury in
the past and psychologically transfer his or her perspective from the past to the present.
Furthermore, it can be considered that the mentality of self-motivation strongly motivates
the orientation from the present to the future. Based on these considerations, it was
hypothesized that the level of acceptance of injury during the rehabilitation period firmly
defines both rehabilitation behaviors and the temporal perspective after returning to
competition, or more specifically, it defines the adaptive state.</p><p>Over the years, studies in the field of athletic rehabilitation have pointed out that
expressing grief has a psychological healing aspect<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, the effectiveness of interventions for cognitive
integration that use emotional disclosure techniques has been examined<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In short, expressing negative emotions about an injury
can be expected to influence AIPA and adaptation after returning to competition. An
important factor at such times is whether athletes have someone in their lives who would
accept the personality features related to emotional expression and emotions; this is a
variable generating individual differences in reactions to injury. Therefore,
characteristics related to DDF and the perception of support including listening and
acceptance were incorporated as variables in this study. Tatsumi<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a relationship between the DDF and inactive
coping behaviors. In the field of competitive sports, there are unique subcultures<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Howard and Nixon<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> pointed out that societal control and force of rationality
in an organization lies in the background, which can impose on and lead an injured athlete
to accept an injury risk and pain and to take the risk of continued athletic activity in
spite of an injury. In the study of Weinberg, Vemau, and Horn<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, athletes with a high athletic identity were reported to display a
positive attitude towards continuation of sports regardless of an injury, and their actual
tendency to do so. Influences of such social and cultural aspects on injured athletes may
include the way they express their negative emotions and coping behaviors after injury.
Mankad and Gordon<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> explained the
following. First, injured athletes take evasive actions toward injury to maintain the norm
of the group and suppress their negative emotions for fear of receiving negative
evaluations. Second, injured athletes recognize that controlling emotions is an encouraged
action in a team environment. At least in competitive sports environments, there appears to
be no foundational atmosphere for freely expressing their worries and feelings about
injuries. Therefore, it is hypothesized that such an environment has an impact on athletes
forming certain characteristics of emotional communication, perceiving and using available
support including listening and acceptance, and having certain attitudes toward injury and
rehabilitation behaviors, which in turn affect their adaptive state after returning to
competition.</p><p>Consequently, in this study, the adaptive state after returning to competition was
classified according to the temporal perspective FB-FF theory. The purpose of this study was
to examine the relationships between differences in individual variables, including
characteristics of emotional expressions during the rehabilitation period (from the
diagnosis and conservation period to the training period), perception of support including
listening and acceptance, and the degrees of injury and psychological damage, as well as
attitudinal variables including AIPA and ARD, and the outcome indices regarding the
perceived physical recovery and the feeling of personal growth at the point of returning to
competition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The criteria for the subjects were set as follows because the degree of injury and
dedication to competitive sport are likely to influence the psychological state of the
injured during rehabilitation and the psychological adaptive state after returning to
completion:</p><p>(a) Active athletes that had experienced an injury and had stopped playing sports for
longer than a week after entering university and had gone through athletic
rehabilitations.</p><p>(b) Athletes who were not currently receiving rehabilitation for their injury and had
returned to sports for longer than one week.</p><p>(c) Student athletes who belonged to the faculty of sports and exercise science at a
sports science university and were expected to aspire to competitive sports and have
strong competitive careers.</p><p>Former athletes who met all the above criteria participated in this study. The criteria
for the period in which they stopped playing sports due to injury and their aspirations
regarding competitive sports followed the criteria used in previous studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. First, prior to this study, an overview of this research was
explained to each adviser of four prominent athletic clubs of a sport science university
and to a medical scientist working as an instructor at the same university. Their consent
to cooperate with this study was obtained (i.e., distribution and collection of the survey
forms). When the study was implemented, subjects were asked to confirm whether they
consented to participate in this research. As a result, 144 athletes with injury
experiences were selected to participate in this study. This study was conducted after
receiving ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Kio University.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The following section describes the athletic injury version of the Temporal Perspective
Scale (TP-S) used to assess adaptation after returning to competition; the Time Dominance
Scale (TD-S); features of DDF during the rehabilitation period; indices related to
perception of support, including listening and acceptance; indices of AIPA and ARD; and
the implementation and analyses of this study.</p><p>First, the athletic injury version of the TP-S, consisting of 12 items, was developed
based on Katsumata&#x02019;s<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> temporal
perspective FB-FF theory. This scale consists of three subscales (i.e., the past
perspective related to injury, the present perspective after returning to competition, and
the future perspective, with four items for each). The scale was developed by adding
context to an unpublished scale developed by Katsumata, an experienced clinical
psychologist. Although Katsumata&#x02019;s original TP-S included a subscale for assessing time
dominance (three items), this subscale was used as an independent index in this study. The
TD-S is an index for assessing the directionality of a respondent&#x02019;s preoccupied thoughts
on a past injury (i.e., past dominance), the present perspective after returning to
competition (i.e., present dominance), and the future perspective (i.e., future
dominance). Based on this scale by Katsumata, the following items were developed:
&#x0201c;preoccupation with the past&#x0201d; (i.e., past dominance) as indicated by the statement, &#x0201c;I
frequently think about having been injured and worry about it&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;preoccupation with the
present&#x0201d; (i.e., present dominance) as indicated by the statement, &#x0201c;I hardly think about
having been injured and about the future&#x0201d;; and &#x0201c;preoccupation with the future&#x0201d; (i.e.,
future dominance) as indicated by the statement, &#x0201c;I am always thinking about the future.&#x0201d;
Subjects were asked to respond by indicating their current situation for these questions
using a 7-point Likert-type response format ranging between 1 (<italic>not at
all</italic>) and 7 (<italic>very much</italic>).</p><p>Second, the DDF Scale (DDF-S: five items), which is one of the subscales of the Toronto
Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS-20) developed by Bagby, Parker, and Taylor<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> was used as an index for assessing the perception of
personality regarding DDF during the rehabilitation period. The TAS-20 is used to measure
alexithymia characteristics. The reliability and validity of the scale had been
confirmed<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The focus of this
study was on evaluating personal traits related to emotional communications and emotional
expressions rather than the characteristics of alexithymia itself. The DDF-S was regarded
as an appropriate measure for assessing characteristics of the self in terms of difficulty
describing, communicating, and expressing emotions. Subjects were asked to recall injury
experiences, and based on their memories about the situation at the time, they were asked
to respond to questions regarding the three scales mentioned above using a 7-point
Likert-type response format ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7
(<italic>very much</italic>). Likewise, to assess perception of support including
listening and acceptance, subjects were asked to divulge whether they had a person who
listens and accepts their worries and emotional disclosures about their injuries using a
3-point Likert-type response format ranging from 1 (<italic>did not have a
person</italic>) to 3 (<italic>had a person</italic>). Those who responded with 3
(<italic>had a person</italic>) were asked to more concretely describe the person.</p><p>Third, the Athletic Injury Psychological Acceptance Scale (AIPA-S)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> consisting of seven items was employed to measure the
degree of AIPA during the rehabilitation period. The AIPA-S is an index for assessing the
degree of psychological acceptance specialized for athletic injury, and it consists of the
following two subscales: &#x0201c;focus on the present&#x0201d; (four items) and &#x0201c;self-motivation&#x0201d; (three
items). The reliability and validity of the AIPA-S has been confirmed. The Athletic
Rehabilitation Dedication Scale (ARD-S) was also used to measure ARD, as it assesses the
degree of dedication to rehabilitation. This scale consists of three items: rehabilitation
participation as indicated by the statement, &#x0201c;I always participate in the scheduled
rehabilitation unless I have a reason to be absent&#x0201d;; rehabilitation completion as
indicated by the statement, &#x0201c;I sufficiently complete the scheduled rehabilitation plan&#x0201d;;
and rehabilitation effort as indicated by the statement, &#x0201c;during the course of
rehabilitation, I am trying to make as much effort as I can to complete the tasks.&#x0201d; In a
study by Tatsumi<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, the ARD-S was used as
an external criterion to examine the validity of the AIPA-S. Subjects were asked to
respond to questions using a 7-point Likert-type response format ranging from 1
(<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very much</italic>).</p><p>Moreover, subjects were asked to indicate their perception of the degree to which the
injury had healed and the recovery of competitiveness at the point of returning to
competition as an index of rehabilitation outcome using an 11-point Likert-type response
format ranging from 0 (<italic>0%</italic>) to 10 (<italic>100%</italic>). Subjects were
also asked to indicate their perceptions about feelings of personal growth using a 7-point
Likert-type response format ranging from 0 (<italic>no growth at all</italic>) to 6
(<italic>significant growth).</italic> &#x0201c;At the point of returning to competition&#x0201d; was
defined as the immediate point at which injured athletes completed rehabilitation and
returned to team practice; &#x0201c;after returning to competition&#x0201d; was defined as when subjects
had been taking part in competitions for longer than a week. Subjects were also asked to
respond to a question written on the face sheet of the survey regarding the degree of
psychological damage that they recognized right after injury using a 4-point Likert-type
response format ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very
much</italic>) and were asked to provide other information including the athletic
events, the results of competition, the date of injury, the name of the injury, and the
degree of the injury (i.e., the number of weeks sports activities were stopped based on a
doctor&#x02019;s diagnosis).</p><p>This study was conducted on an anonymous basis. The survey form distributed to former
injured athletes was placed in an envelope with an attached letter requesting
participation in this study. Those who consented to participate in the study were asked to
take out the survey form and respond to the questions. When collecting the survey form,
regardless of the responses, the subjects were asked to place the form in the original
envelope and seal it. If the subjects had multiple injury experiences in the past, they
were asked to pick one of the most memorable injury events and respond about that
event.</p><p>The data analysis is described in the following section.</p><p>First, the structures of the following scales were examined: the three subscales of the
athletic injury version of the TP-S (i.e., the past, the present, and the future
perspectives), which evaluates the adaptive state after returning to competition, and the
existing DDF-S. This examination was conducted because the TP-S is a revised version of
Katsumata&#x02019;s scale, and the subjects were asked to respond to the DDF-S based on their
memory about the situation at the time of injury. A principal component analysis was
conducted for the items in each scale, and the validity of the scales was judged based on
whether unidimensionality of each scale was confirmed. This is because the three
segmentation units were used as a premise in the previous studies for the TP-S<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and one of the TAS-20<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> subscales was used for the DDF-S. Regarding the
reliability, the internal consistency of each scale was examined by using Cronbach&#x02019;s
coefficient &#x003b1;. In a related study, Tatsumi and Takenouchi<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> confirmed the factorial invariance of AIPA-S for self-motivation
(three items) and focus on the present (three items). The data of that study were utilized
in this study. Therefore, the content structure of the scale was not reexamined. Next,
correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship among the concept of time after
returning to competition, each scale assessing psychological and behavioral factors during
the rehabilitation period, and the rehabilitation outcome indices at the point of
returning to competition. The total scores of the three subscales of the athletic injury
version of the TP-S and the DDF-S scale, two subscales of the AIPA-S, and the complete
AIPA-S scale were calculated. Then, the total scores were divided by the numbers of items.
Raw data were used for the following scale scores: the three subscales consisting of the
TD-S (i.e., the past, present, and future dominances), the perception of support including
listening and acceptance, the three subscales comprising the ARD-S (i.e., rehabilitation
participation, rehabilitation completion, and rehabilitation effort), the perception of
injury healing and recovery of performance for competition, and perception of personal
growth. Next, based on the three perspectives of the athletic injury version of the TP-S,
a cluster analysis was used to identify the modality of the sequence of temporal
perspectives (i.e., time perspective chain modalities) after returning to competition.
Furthermore, ANOVA was used to examine the relationship between the modality of the
sequence (i.e., time perspective chain modalities) and TD-S to enhance the validity of the
three clusters identified as an optimal solution. Lastly, ANOVA was used to examine the
relationships among the following variables: the modality of the sequence of temporal
perspectives (i.e., time perspective chain modalities) at the point of returning to
competition and the degrees of injury (i.e., the number of weeks that playing sports was
stopped) and psychological damage at the time of injury, the DDF-S and perception of
support during the rehabilitation period, the AIPA-S and ARD-S, and the perceptions of
injury healing, the recovery of performance for competition, and the feeling of personal
growth at the point to returning to competition.</p><p>The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and the null hypothesis was
rejected at the &#x003b1;=0.05 significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The data for 113 subjects (mean age = 20.22, SD = 1.07) who responded to all the scales
used in this study were analyzed. The mean weeks without playing sports based on a doctor&#x02019;s
diagnosis was 7.98 weeks (SD=11.74). The athletic levels of the subjects&#x02019; teams were rather
high (intercollege or pre-intercollege level). All the colleges to which the teams belonged
had a tradition of playing sports. Therefore, all the teams had excellent coaches and were
highly organized.</p><p>First, a principal component analysis was conducted to examine the structure of each
subscale of the athletic injury version of the TP-S (i.e., the past, present, and future
perspectives). As can be seen in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> (a),

component loadings of each scale were high and larger than 0.55. The internal consistency
for each scale was also found to be satisfactory, ranging from &#x003b1;=0.67 to 0.71. A principal
component analysis was also conducted for five items of the DDF-S. The results indicated
that the scale was unidimensional. Principal component loadings ranged from 0.69 to 0.88,
and the internal consistency reliability of the five items was found to be satisfactory
(&#x003b1;=0.85). More specifically, the items in the order of higher to lower principal component
loadings were as follows: &#x0201c;I am not able to describe my feelings easily,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;I find it hard to
describe how I feel about people,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;It is difficult for me to find the right words for my
feelings,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;It is difficult for me to reveal my innermost feelings, even to close friends,&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;People tell me to describe my feelings more.&#x0201d; These results demonstrated the
reliability and validity of the scale.</p><p>Second, <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Correlations between the concept of time after returning to competition and

*Applies to this scale only (N=103)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows results concerning the correlations among the three subscales of the
TP-S, TD-S, individual differences (the degrees of injury and perceived psychological damage
at the time of injury, the DDF, and the perception of support), attitudinal variables (AIPA
and ARD), and outcome indices (perceptions of injury healing, recovery of performance, and
feeling of personal growth). Regarding the concept of time, the correlations among each
temporal perspective subscale (i.e., the past, the present, and the future) were
significant, with r ranging from 0.56 to 0.73. Significant correlations were also found
between each temporal perspective and future dominance, with r ranging from 0.26 to 0.40.
These results indicated that although each perspective is a theoretical segmentation unit,
the perspectives could positively and synchronously influence one another. Moreover, higher
levels of each perspective implied preoccupation with the future (i.e., future dominance) as
the orientation of thoughts and behaviors. Next, we investigated the relationship between
the concept of time and variables of individual differences and found statistically
significant negative correlations among each perspective and the DDF, with r ranging from
&#x02212;0.20 to &#x02212;0.30. However, the correlations among each perspective and the degree of injury,
as well as each perspective and the degree of psychological damage, were not significant
(ranging from r=&#x02212;0.04 to 0.06 and from r=&#x02212;0.01 to &#x02212;0.12, respectively). The relationships
between each perspective and indices of rehabilitation attitudes revealed the following
statistically significant positive correlations: each perspective and self-motivation for
accepting an injury (from r=0.41 to 0.46); each perspective and focus on the present (from
r=0.33 to 0.46), and each perspective and the total AIPA-S score (from r=0.41 to 0.49).
Regarding the correlations among each perspective and ARD, rehabilitation effort was
especially positively correlated with each perspective, with r ranging from 0.30 to 0.38.
Lastly, the correlations among each perspective and rehabilitation outcome indices revealed
the following statistically significant positive correlations: each perspective and the
perception of recovery of performance for competition (from r=0.28 to 0.46) and each
perspective and the feeling of personal growth (from r=0.46 to 0.50). Regarding the
correlation between time dominance and variables of individual differences, a statistically
significant positive correlation was found between past dominance and DDF (r=0.20).
Similarly, the correlations among time dominance, the attitudinal indices for
rehabilitation, and outcome indices revealed the following statistically significant
negative correlation: preoccupation with the past (i.e., past dominance) and focus on the
present in AIPA (r=&#x02212;0.20) and preoccupation with the past (i.e., past dominance) and the
perception of recovery of performance for competition (r=&#x02212;0.23). Furthermore, correlations
between preoccupation with the future (i.e., future dominance) and the following subscales
of AIPA had statistically significant positive correlations: self-motivation, rehabilitation
effort, and perception of feelings of personal growth (r=0.32, 0.25, and 0.34,
respectively). These results assumed that the degrees of injury and psychological damage at
the time of injury did not relate to adaptation after returning to competition, whereas
athletes with a high level of DDF tended to persist in the past reality of being injured in
the present, even after returning to competition, and had problems with maintaining the
correct temporal perspective. Therefore, it can be assumed that they returned in a
maladaptive way. It was hypothesized that athletes who are in an adaptive state after
returning to competition following an injury would be more preoccupied with the future
(i.e., future dominance) compared with those who are in a maladaptive state. It was also
assumed that adaptive athletes would have a high level of AIPA and ARD during the
rehabilitation period, that they would strongly perceive their recovery from the injury,
that they would recover their competitive performance, and that they would have a feeling of
personal growth at the point of returning to competition.</p><p>Next, adaptation after returning to competition was observed from the modality of the
sequence of temporal perspectives (i.e., time perspective chain modality) on the basis of
the correlation analyses described above. Moreover, individual differences, attitudinal
indices, and outcome indices were examined for each modality (i.e., chain modality).</p><p>First, cluster analysis (complete-linkage method, squared Euclidean distance) was conducted
to find the optimal solution for the modality of the sequence of temporal perspectives
(i.e., time perspective chain modality) using scores of the three subscales of the athletic
injury version of the TP-S as variables and all subjects as the cases. The optimal solution
suggested three clusters. The results of one-way ANOVA were significant at an alpha level of
1% for the three levels of the TP-S. Based on the results of multiple comparison tests
conducted with the LSD method, three clusters were used. These results are presented in

(i.e., positive chain modalities) gave positive meaning to a past of having been injured at
the present after returning to competition. This makes it possible for athletes to predict a
positive future and maintains these positive sequences. In addition, those with this
modality have their thoughts and behavior oriented toward the future, which could be the
most adaptive modality for returning to sports. The numbers of subjects who fell into each
category were as follows: 78 for the neutral chain modality, 29 for the positive chain
modality, and 6 for the negative chain modality. The results of a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test showed
significantly different numbers of subjects in each cluster (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=71.81, df=2,
p=0.00).</p><p>Lastly, one-way ANOVA was conducted with the three modalities of the sequence of temporal
perspectives (i.e., time perspective chain modalities) after returning to competition as
independent variables, and the degree of the injury (i.e., the number of weeks the athlete
stopped playing sports), degree of perceived psychological damage at the time of injury,
DDF-S, perception of support, AIPA-S, ARD-S, perceptions of injury healing and recovery of
performance for competition, and perception of personal growth as dependent variables. The

difference was found among the modalities for the following variables: the degree of injury
and degree of perceived psychological damage at the time of injury, the DDF, and the
perception of support. On the other hand, significant differences were found among the
modalities for variables including all the scales of AIPA and ARD, and perception of
recovery of performance for competition and feeling of personal growth of outcome indices
for rehabilitation. The results of multiple comparison tests conducted with the LSD method
showed that subjects in C-1 (positive chain modality) had higher AIPA levels and ARD during
rehabilitation than those in C-2 (neutral chain modality) and C-3 (negative chain modality),
had stronger perceptions about the recovery of performance for competition, and felt more
strongly about personal growth at the point of returning to sports.</p><p>In this study, statistically significant correlations were found among DDF and the past,
present, and future perspectives; however, no significant differences were found among the
modalities of the sequence of temporal perspectives. Inconsistent results were not
sufficient to question the original hypothesis. Therefore, as a supplemental analysis,
additional correlation analyses were conducted between the DDF-S and AIPA-S. The results
showed statistically significant negative correlations between the DDF-S and the subscales
of the AIPA-S as follows: with the focus on the present, r=&#x02212;0.34 (p&#x0003c;0.00); with
self-motivation, r=&#x02212;0.19 (p&#x0003c;0.05); and with the whole AIPA, r=&#x02212;0.30 (p&#x0003c;0.01). Based on
the results, partial correlations were calculated between the DDF-S and each perspective
with the whole AIPA as the control variable. The results of partial correlations were as
follows: with the past perspective, r=&#x02212;0.07 (p&#x0003e;0.05); with the present perspective,
r=&#x02212;0.21 (p&#x0003c;0.05); and with the future perspective, r=&#x02212;0.16 (p&#x0003e;0.05). The original
correlation coefficient decreased significantly, and the correlations were not significant
except for DDF-S and the present perspective.</p><p>Put simply, the level of DDF does not directly impact adaptation after returning to
competition, but it has a mediation effect on adaptation through AIPA. In other words, the
significant correlations between DDF and each perspective can be regarded as spurious
correlation. However, a mediation variable, AIPA, does play a role in such significant
correlations.</p><p>The above results can be summarized as follows.</p><p>First, the adaptive state after returning to competition can be understood from each
modality (i.e., positive, neutral, and negative chains) of temporal perspective. The method
of maintaining the temporal perspective for the positive modality of sequence (i.e.,
positive chain mode) is to have a preoccupation with the future (i.e., future dominance).
Second, the largest number of injured athletes that return to competition fell into the
neutral sequence of modality (i.e., neutral chain mode) for the temporal perspectives,
whereas a few of them fell into the negative sequence of modality (i.e., negative chain
mode). Third, it was found that the degree of injury and the degree of psychological damage
at the time of injury did not impact adaptation after returning to competition. Fourth, the
levels of AIPA and ARD during the rehabilitation period defined the adaptive state after
returning to competition. The rehabilitation outcome levels with regard to recovery of
performance for competition and feeling personal growth at the point of returning are also
important factors for prediction of injured athletes&#x02019; adaptation after returning to
competition. Fifth, DDF characteristics do not directly impact adaptation after returning to
competition. However, they may indirectly impact such adaptation through AIPA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Most previous research has examined the short-term effects of using a direct approach, such
as reducing injured athletes&#x02019; psychological stress and negative emotions or encouraging
positive changes in coping behaviors (e.g., rehabilitation). Therefore, it has been
difficult to discuss injured athletes&#x02019; adaptive states after returning to competition.
Consequently, the psychological interventions for injured athletes proposed by previous
studies have been rather limited. In this study, Katsumata&#x02019;s temporal perspective FB-FF
theory<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to understand injured
athletes&#x02019; adaptive state after returning to competition. The injured athletes&#x02019; psychological
and behavioral factors during the rehabilitation period were examined, as they influence the
temporal perspective.</p><p>The correlation coefficients among subscales of the TP-S suggested that three perspectives
(i.e., the past after returning to competition, the present, and the future) positively
influenced each other and maintained the impact of the athlete&#x02019;s perspective, and this was
supported by the results of cluster analyses (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table
3</xref>). Furthermore, significantly different numbers of subjects in each cluster were
found in the three modalities of the sequence (i.e., positive, neutral, and negative
chains), with the ratios being 25.66%, 69.03%, and 5.31%, respectively. The results
indicated that only a quarter of the subjects were in the adaptive and positive modality of
the sequence (i.e., positive chain modality); therefore, the athletes&#x02019; adaptive state after
returning to competition could not always be positive. Although further examination is
needed, those who are in the negative modality of the sequence (i.e., negative chain
modality) may include people with psychopathological or clinical problems.</p><p>Next, examination of the present perspective, after returning to competition, in
attitudinal variables during rehabilitation and rehabilitation outcome indices revealed that
those who demonstrated high levels of AIPA and ARD during rehabilitation clearly perceived
recovery of performance. Moreover strong feelings about personal growth at the point of
returning were indicative of a better adaptive state afterwards. Previous studies have
already provided evidence of the causal relationship between AIPA and ARD<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, Tatsumi<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> elucidated that AIPA
and the perceived physical recovery or the perceived personal growth when returning to
competition were positively related. It is suggested that important factors for personal
growth, physical recovery, and adaptation after returning include facing the injury event
(i.e., crisis), devotion to the coping effort (i.e., rehabilitation) for overcoming an
injury, and experience of mutuality under crisis conditions<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although previous studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> have pointed out the effectiveness of
psychological support using AIPA as a goal, the results of this study added the implication
that the effectiveness of psychological support was not limited to the rehabilitation period
but could be extended to the adaptive state after returning to competition.</p><p>The results of correlation analyses between the DDF-S and AIPA-S, as well as those of
partial correlation analyses between the DDF-S and each of the temporal perspectives with
AIPA as the control variables leads to the hypothesis that DDF characteristics of injured
athletes indirectly influence each perspective with the mediation effect of AIPA. The
results of correlation analysis between DDF and preoccupation with the past (i.e., the past
dominance) demonstrated that injured athletes that had a higher level of DDF characteristics
tended to persist in the pre-injury self, which was disconnected from the present self. This
may lead to difficulties in moving onto AIPA and the practice of positive rehabilitation
behaviors. Therefore, examining the characteristics of personality such as DDF (e.g.,
emotional communication and emotional expression) or variables describing individual
differences (e.g., emotional competence and emotional intelligence) are suggested to be
effective and to have meaning for interventions that support AIPA and adaptation after
returning to competition.</p><p>Lastly, the tasks for future studies are outlined next. This study examined injured
athletes&#x02019; perceptions of support including listening and acceptance; however, no significant
correlation was found with adaptation after returning to competition. The subjects were
asked to indicate if they had received support and to describe the person who gave them
support. However, they were not asked to indicate whether the support was effective.
Moreover, multiple names were often listed as support providers; therefore, it was difficult
to identify the effective support provider to incorporate the information into the analysis
in this study. The influence of a support provider who listens to and accepts an injured
athlete&#x02019;s worries and emotions is expected to be significant; therefore, it is urgent to
establish a research model incorporating this perspective. On the other hand, the kinds of
effective support can be expected to vary rather than just being listening and acceptance.
Future research needs to examine who is an effective support provider, what support is
effective, and which stage in rehabilitation and what rehabilitation condition are
effective. By incorporating these perspectives<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> into a research model, the standpoint for psychological
intervention will be more concrete. In addition, a supplemental test was conducted in this
study; however, it is necessary to fully examine the influence of personality
characteristics related to emotional communication and emotional expressions (e.g., DDF) and
the variables describing individual differences (e.g., emotional competence and emotional
intelligence) on AIPA and ARD. Such investigations would lead to effective psychological
support that takes individual differences into consideration. Lastly, limitations of this
study are discussed. The adaptive state of injured athletes after returning to competition
does not always remain fixed, and it can change gradually. However, it was not possible to
examine this topic in the analysis in this study; therefore, future studies need to examine
injured athletes through longitudinal research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society
