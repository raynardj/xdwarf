Depending on the microenvironment, macrophages can polarize to two distinct phenotypes. The M1 phenotype is activated by IFN-&#x003b3; and bacterial products, and displays an inflammatory profile, while M2 macrophages are activated by IL-4 and tend to be anti-inflammatory or immunosupressive. It was observed that DnaK from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> has immunosuppressive properties, inducing a tolerogenic phenotype in dendritic cells and MDSCs, contributing to graft acceptance and tumor growth. However, its role in macrophage polarization remains to be elucidated. We asked whether DnaK was able to modulate macrophage phenotype. Murine macrophages, derived from bone marrow, or from the peritoneum, were incubated with DnaK and their phenotype compared to M1 or M2 polarized macrophages. Treatment with DnaK leads macrophages to present higher arginase I activity, IL-10 production and FIZZ1 and Ym1 expression. Furthermore, DnaK increased surface levels of CD206. Importantly, DnaK-treated macrophages were able to promote tumor growth in an allogeneic melanoma model. Our results suggest that DnaK polarizes macrophages to the M2-like phenotype and could constitute a virulence factor and is an important immunomodulator of macrophage responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>RLL, TJB, JFA, NGP, SPM, ADS, RFZ, and CB were funded by Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fapergs.rs.gov.br">www.fapergs.rs.gov.br</ext-link>) grant number 11/0903-1, PUCRS and FINEP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.finep.gov.br">www.finep.gov.br</ext-link>) grant 01.08.0600-00.

These cells have a marked phenotypic heterogeneity, which is dependent on the microenvironment conditions. T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines stimulate macrophage to differentiate into two opposed phenotypes. Classically activated macrophages (M1) are induced by Th1 cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;), or by bacterial products (e.g LPS). They are able to control infections, have a tumoricidal activity and secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively activated macrophages (M2) are induced by Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and/or IL-13) and have important roles in allergy, parasitic infections and tissue repair <xref rid="pone.0113441-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Both phenotypes can be differentiated by surface receptors, gene expression and cytokines profile produced. M1 macrophages express CD80, CD86, produce NO and secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2;. M2 macrophages express CD206 and CD163. They can produce IL-10, TGF-&#x003b2; and show an increased arginase I activity <xref rid="pone.0113441-Gordon2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, M2 macrophage polarization can be defined based on a specific genetic signature characterized by the upregulation of Ym1 (also known as <italic>Chil3l3</italic>) and FIZZ1 (also known as <italic>Retnla</italic>) genes <xref rid="pone.0113441-Raes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113441-Raes2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Both in infections and tumors, a switch from Th1 (or M1) to Th2 (or M2) immunity can occur, leading to the generation of a suppressive environment that abrogates effector immunity <xref rid="pone.0113441-Sica1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. During mycobacterial infections, the generation of suppressive macrophage populations coincides with a switch from a Th1 to a Th2 response, and such macrophages are important for the persistence of the pathogen <xref rid="pone.0113441-Tomioka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> can reprogram macrophages to M2 via secretion of IL-10 <xref rid="pone.0113441-LugoVillarino1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, a major immunosuppressant that counteracts IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, the two major cytokines that drive the effective response that clears the infection. In tumors, macrophages infiltrate the microenvironment, and modulate T-cell and stroma activity, either promoting or inhibiting tumor progression <xref rid="pone.0113441-deSouza1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Also, in human macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the repression of IL-10 leads to an enhancement of phagosome protease activity, leading to a higher eradication of the pathogen <xref rid="pone.0113441-Chandra1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>In vivo</italic>, macrophage polarization induced by IL-10 is associated with the production of this cytokine in infected organs <xref rid="pone.0113441-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113441-Redente1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and tumor microenvironment <xref rid="pone.0113441-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113441-Sica2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. To assess the role of IL-10 specifically produced by macrophages, Schreiber <italic>et al.</italic> infected macrophages from mice in which IL-10 was upregulated in these cells with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113441-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. These animals were more susceptible to infection, died early and exhibited a higher bacterial load in the lungs. In the same study, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected macrophages had a M2 phenotype. In <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infected RAW 264.7 macrophages, the parasite Hsp70 inhibited production of NO and NF-kB activation, resulting in increased parasite load <xref rid="pone.0113441-Dobbin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In both cases, macrophage modulation is a major strategy to evade effector immune responses, avoiding tumor destruction and pathogen eradication. We show that DnaK induce the production of IL-10 by macrophages and polarization to M2 phenotype. Because most of the co-injected allogeneic macrophages are found dead inside the tumors on day 16, we believe that the effect of the DnaK polarized BMMs is very robust and occurs very early, allowing the implantation of the tumor in the host. It is possible that DnaK acts as an immunomodulator with a putative virulence role in bacterial infections, polarizing macrophages to M2, with production of IL-10.</p><p>DnaK was found within vesicle membranes released by mycobacteria which can modulate macrophages in a pathway dependent on TLR2 <xref rid="pone.0113441-PradosRosales1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Other molecules from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, like the PPE18 protein, induce IL-10 production through TLR2 in order to evade effector immune responses mediated by CD4+ T cells <xref rid="pone.0113441-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113441-Nair1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Chalmin et al. demonstrated that both murine and human HSP70 present in exossome membranes released from tumor cells enhances immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs <xref rid="pone.0113441-Chalmin1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, leading to tumor growth, in a TLR-2, IL-10 dependent mechanism. It is thus possible to hypothesize that other members of the Hsp70 family, when released from infected or tumor cells in vesicles, can engage a TLR2 pathway, leading to IL-10 production in myeloid cells, and polarizing macrophages to an M2 phenotype. This pathway would be activated both in infections and tumors, and further experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>6 to 10-weeks-old female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from FEPPS (Rio Grande do Sul, BRA).
