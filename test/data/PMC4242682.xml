Together, these chaperones provide a compartment in which a substrate polypeptide is isolated from the cellular environment and can safely fold in an ATP - dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0113835-Hartl1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The prototypical system found in <italic>E. coli</italic> provides the bulk of our knowledge on the oligomeric chaperonin complexes. For this system, high resolution structures of the GroEL tetradecamer (Cpn60) and its co-chaperonin, the GroES heptamer (Cpn10), have been solved by X-ray crystallography both individually and in a variety of complexes <xref rid="pone.0113835-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113835-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Two seven-membered rings of GroEL form the main chaperonin structure in which the substrate protein finds protection. Seven subunits of GroES assemble into dome-like structures, which cap the ends of the GroEL cylinder and induce formation of the protein-folding chamber. The interaction between the two oligomers is mediated by a &#x0223c;20 residue sequence of GroES, known as the &#x02018;mobile loop&#x02019;, an unstructured region that adopts a &#x003b2;-hairpin conformation when bound to GroEL <xref rid="pone.0113835-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113835-Landry1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113835-Landry2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. At the other end of the GroES subunit is an additional loop, seven of which form a roof-like ceiling in the heptameric co-chaperonin oligomer.</p><p>In contrast to the simple homo-oligomeric structures found in <italic>E. coli</italic>, chloroplast chaperonins are unique in three aspects: 1) Chloroplasts harbor duplicated chaperonin and co-chaperonin genes. For example, chloroplasts generally contain two chaperonin subtypes, Cpn60&#x003b1; and Cpn60&#x003b2;. They also harbor two structurally distinct co-chaperonin proteins, the gene of one (cpn10) which encodes for a 10 kDa subunit, and the gene of the second (cpn20), which consists of two homologous cpn10 sequences joined head-to-tail. 2) Often, greater than one gene for each subtype is present in the genome. 3) Both chaperonin and co-chaperonin subunits can assemble into a variety of functional homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes. Cpn60&#x003b1;&#x003b2; hetero-oligomer is the most abundant oligomeric form <italic>in vivo</italic> (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0113835-VitlinGruber1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>), although the Cpn60&#x003b2; subunits were shown to be functional as homo-oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic>

For this purpose, we carried out refolding experiments using GroEL or Cpn60&#x003b1;&#x003b2; (10 &#x000b5;M), which was supplemented with a constant concentration of inactive Cpn10(1) (20 &#x000b5;M) and increasing concentrations of Cpn20 (0.625&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;M). Since Cpn10(1) alone was not able to assist chaperonin in mediating protein folding at any concentration, we assumed that any increase in the refolding yield above that of Cpn20 alone, would be due to the formation of mixed hetero-oligomers.</p><p>Interestingly, a clear synergistic effect can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g002">Figure 2</xref> upon titrating Cpn20 in the presence of a constant concentration of Cpn10(1). At low concentrations of Cpn20 (for example 0.25 ratio of [co-chaperonin]/[GroEL]), where the refolding yield is sub-saturating for Cpn20 alone, the presence of Cpn10(1) resulted in a 5-fold increase in refolding activity (15.71% and 78.26% respectively - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A similar effect was seen using Cpn60&#x003b1;&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In this case, the increase in refolding was from 51.39% to 77.83%. These results suggest that Cpn20 and Cpn10(1) combined to form functional hetero-oligomeric species.</p><p>In order to further explore the hetero-oligomerization, we separated mixtures containing different Cpn20/Cpn10(1) ratios on a native gel. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g003">Figure 3</xref>, upon mixing these two co-chaperonins, a new band appears above Cpn20, representing the formation of a Cpn20-Cpn10(1) hetero-oligomer. It can be seen that Cpn20 homo-oligomer never dissociates completely, even in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of Cpn10(1). In this regard, it is also interesting to note that hetero-oligomer formation is spontaneous and does not depend on any other factors like Cpn60 or ATP.</p><fig id="pone-0113835-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113835.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Visualization of Cpn10(1)-Cpn20 hetero-oligomer by native gel.</title><p>Co-chaperonin proteins were diluted to 100 &#x000b5;M each (protomer) and then mixed to obtain the indicated ratios.

This Cpn20 mutant is modified at a highly conserved glycine, which was shown to be important for the flexibility of the mobile loop &#x02013; the region that facilitates binding of co-chaperonin to Cpn60. G32 is located in the N-domain of Cpn20 and its substitution to alanine results in a co-chaperonin which is inactive at 37&#x000b0;C. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g005">Figure 5</xref>, while both G32A and Cpn10(1) are individually inactive, their combination resulted in &#x0223c;75% co-chaperonin activity with GroEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and &#x0223c;40% using chloroplast Cpn60&#x003b1;&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113835-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus the presence of small amount of G32A can serve as a template for Cpn10(1) oligomerization, resulting in active mixed oligomers. Reciprocally, the presence of Cpn10(1) molecule in the mixed oligomer is sufficient to fully rescue co-chaperonin activity of the inactive G32A mutant. While the general refolding trends using chloroplast Cpn60&#x003b1;&#x003b2; were similar to those using GroEL, some differences were observed in the refolding pattern or yields. For example, Cpn60&#x003b1;&#x003b2; refolding yields are much lower with G32A and Cpn10(1), than they are using GroEL.

A combination of the different properties of each co-chaperonin homolog with the various possible oligomeric arrangements may allow for greater flexibility of protein refolding in chloroplasts.
