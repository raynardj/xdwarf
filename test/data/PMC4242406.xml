In this study, a nanoparticles-delivery system for AmpB (NQC-AmpB), containing chitosan and chondroitin sulfate molecules, was evaluated in BALB/c mice against <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic>. An in vivo biodistribution study, including biochemical and toxicological evaluations, was performed to evaluate the toxicity of AmpB. Nanoparticles were radiolabeled with technetium-99m and injected in mice. The products presented a similar biodistribution in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of the animals. Free AmpB induced alterations in the body weight of the mice, which, in the biochemical analysis, indicated hepatic and renal injury, as well as morphological damage to the kidneys of the animals. In general, no significant organic alteration was observed in the animals treated with NQC-AmpB. Mice were infected with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and treated with the nanoparticles or free AmpB; then, parasitological and immunological analyses were performed. The NQC-AmpB group, as compared to the control groups, presented significant reductions in the lesion size and in the parasite burden in all evaluated organs. These animals presented significantly higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12, and low levels of IL-4 and IL-10, when compared to the control groups. The NQC-AmpB system was effective in reducing the infection in the animals, and proved to be effective in diminishing the toxicity evoked by AmpB, which was observed when it was administered alone. In conclusion, NQC-AmpB could be considered a viable possibility for future studies in the treatment of leishmaniasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>in vivo treatment</kwd><kwd><italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic></kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>chitosan</kwd><kwd>chondroitin sulfate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leishmaniasis is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by protozoa belonging to the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genus.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Currently, nearly 350 million people in 98 countries are at risk of contracting the infection,<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> whereas between 700,000 and 1.2 million cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis, and about 500,000 cases of visceral leishmaniasis, are diagnosed annually worldwide.<xref rid="b3-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The first choice to treat leishmaniasis has been the employ of pentavalent antimony; however, the side effects, such as myalgias, arthralgias, pancreatitis, leukopenia, and cardiotoxicity, are problems reported by patients.<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Amphotericin B (AmpB), a polyene used in the treatment of the disease, is a highly hydrophobic antifungal drug.

To analyze the variation in body weight, the value before treatment was used as the covariate,<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni&#x02019;s post-test, was used to compare differences between the groups. To analyze biochemical parameters, the computed normalized absorbance ratios were used, by correcting the mean optical density value for each sample from NQ, NQC, NQC-AmpB, and free AmpB groups, and dividing it by the mean optical density value from the control group. As a consequence, the normalized absorbance ratios represent multiples of reactivity in relation to the control group.<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> To analyze the lesion size, parasite burden, and immunological response between the groups, the two-way ANOVA and the area under the curve, followed by Bonferroni&#x02019;s post-test, were used.

The NQC and NQC-AmpB nanoparticles presented similar biodistribution profiles in the spleen and liver of the treated animals, during the period of time that they were evaluated; however, at 24 h after administration, the NQC presented a higher presence in the spleen, when compared to the NQC-AmpB nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5341">Figure 1A</xref>). This evaluation could be also observed in the scintigraphic images, demonstrating a decreasing of the biodistribution profile of the nanoparticles in the abdominal region of the animals, after 24 h of administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5341">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo toxicity studies</title><p>Some clinical symptoms, such as ataxia and weakness, were observed in the free AmpB-treated mice, while in the animals treated with NQ, NQC, or NQC-AmpB nanoparticles, no clinical alteration was observed.

The body weight of the mice was monitored from 0 to 12 days during the treatment, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5341">Figure 2</xref> shows the results. The control group (nontreated and noninfected) presented a positive variation in weight, reaching a maximum of up to 6% relative to the weight of the animals, as compared to the beginning of the treatment. The NQ and NQC groups presented a light negative variation in weight of up to 4%. The NQC-AmpB group presented a negative variation in weight, reaching a maximum of 5%. However, for the free AmpB group, the loss of body weight presented a negative variation of 15%, possibly reflecting the high toxicity of this drug observed in the animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5341">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The results of dosage of markers of cardiac, hepatic, and renal damage are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5341">Figure 3A</xref>. The administration of free AmpB did not affect the CK/MB levels, indicating no cardiac damage, but the levels of GGT, AST, ALT, BUN, and serum creatinine increased in these animals. In the animals treated with NQ, NQC, and NQC-AmpB nanoparticles, no alteration was observed. Thus, this finding indicates that the NQC-AmpB system may well be able to diminish the hepatic and renal toxicity caused by free AmpB. Moreover, no hematological alteration was observed in any of the evaluated groups (data not shown).</p><p>The histological photomicrographs of animals treated with free AmpB exhibited mild to moderate renal tubular nephrosis, with glomerulonephritis; loss of the morphology of the proximal tubules and capillaries; hyperemic and shapeless blood vessels; and loss of the morphology of the animals&#x02019; tissue cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-5341">Figure 3B</xref>). Interstitial and intraluminal calcified foci appeared as a result of the mineralization of injured support and epithelial cells.

No significant difference could be found between the NQ and NQC groups. The NQC-AmpB group presented a smaller lesion size, which was sustained up to 30 days after the treatment in relation to the AmpB group and others, when the area under the curve was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5341">Figure 4B</xref>).

The ratio between IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4, IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-10, IL-12/IL-4, and IL-12/IL-10 was also calculated, and the results showed that nanoparticles primed the infected animals to produce high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12, corroborating with the significant reduction observed in the parasite burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5341">Figure 4D</xref>). Nevertheless, spleen cells of animals treated with free AmpB, as compared to the NQC-AmpB group, also presented significantly higher IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-10 ratios, but lower IL-12/IL-4 and IL-12/IL-10 ratios.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current treatments for leishmaniasis have been considered to have low satisfaction, mainly due to the high toxicity of the products.

The moderate levels of radioactivity observed in the kidneys could be explained by the leakage of <sup>99m</sup>Tc from the nanoparticles, most likely as a result of the degradation process of them, as well as due to the slight uptake of the delivery system in the heart, probably due to the positive charge of the nanoparticles.<xref rid="b20-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It has been postulated that particulate drug carriers can substantially influence not only pharmacokinetics, but also the biodistribution of drugs.<xref rid="b29-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In this context, the particulate nature of vehicles may well facilitate the passive guidance of entrapped molecules to the inside of the macrophages.<xref rid="b30-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Recently, He et al described that the control of particle size and surface charge has a direct effect on biodistribution, and is a significant issue in the rational design of drug nanocarriers.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the present study, all of the obtained nanoparticles presented a positive charge and sizes of approximately 79&#x02013;136 nm.<xref rid="b17-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, positively charged nanoparticles accumulate in mononuclear phagocytes at about two-fold more than negatively charged carriers.<xref rid="b33-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Danesh-Bahreini et al described that the positively charged nanoparticles, as compared to negative or neutral charged nanoparticles, are more quickly taken up by macrophages through phagocytosis.<xref rid="b35-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The mechanism of action proposed for the toxic effect of AmpB is derived from its interaction with sterols in bilayer membranes, such as cell walls, causing pore formation in the membrane, in turn leading either to its destruction or to the inhibition of membrane repair.

This fact could explain, at least in part, the higher presence of NQC and NQC-AmpB in the spleen of the treated animals.</p><p>In the present study, the liver could be also considered a site of accumulation of the nanoparticles in the mice; in this context, a toxicological study was performed on this organ. Clinically significant increases in hepatocyte-associated serum enzymes were observed in the animals treated with free AmpB, with a significant difference observed in the levels of GGT, AST, and ALT between the groups that received NQC-AmpB and free AmpB, which may well indicate a decrease in the hepatic toxicity when AmpB is administered in the NQC system, although used at the same dose.</p><p>The nephrotoxicity is considered perhaps the most described adverse drug event for AmpB.<xref rid="b46-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The pathophysiology and pharmacology of this activity have been well-documented, and the proposed mechanism has been described as being multifactorial.<xref rid="b47-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The BUN and serum creatinine showed significant increases in the animals treated with AmpB.

Firstly, the dosage employed of the drug in this system is considered low (1 mg per kg per day), which could be impacting in the null side effects observed in the treated mice. Although the mouse model cannot be extrapolated to the model, it is a good perspective that NQC-AmpB could also be less toxic in the patients. Secondly, although NQC-AmpB does not at present have an estimated value of sale, due to the fact that this product is composed of two known commercial products &#x02013; ChS and Cs &#x02013; one could speculate that the NQC-AmpB nanoparticles may well have a lesser cost in comparison to the other available commercial lipid-AmpB formulations.<xref rid="b17-ijn-9-5341" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Therapeutic and vaccine studies concerning leishmaniasis call for the critical evaluation of the parasitological and immunological parameters of the most common animal models today.

In this light, the NQC-AmpB nanoparticles could be considered as effective therapeutic agents; once the results obtained in the animals treated with this product were compared with the data shown in the free-AmpB-treated group, although not all parasites had been eliminated. However, additional studies are certainly necessary to improve the therapeutic index of NQC-AmpB, either by increasing the number of doses of the product, or the duration of the treatment; in order to clear the largest possible number of parasites in the infected animals. On the other hand, the evaluation of the treatment in other mammal models could also be of interest, in order to estimate the efficacy of the nanoparticles, in mammals that are not as susceptible as BALB/c mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, based on the results involving the in vivo biodistribution, and with the evaluation of the biochemical, toxicological, parasitological, and immunological parameters associated with the treatment of mice infected with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>, the NQC-AmpB nanoparticles could be applied as an alternative AmpB delivery system, maintaining the high activity of this drug against <italic>Leishmania</italic>, but reducing by significant levels its toxicity, compared to when it is administered in a free form.
