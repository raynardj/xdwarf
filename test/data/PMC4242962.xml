It does not need a lot of time or space.
People can enjoy walking regardless of their age, because it is the most common movement.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends consistent walking exercise to prevent and
treat low back pain. Walking exercise strengthens the back and abdominal muscles, thereby
reducing back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, it is
beneficial for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and can help improve breathing
capacity and relieve pain by activating the lumbar deep muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The causes of low back pain are diverse and complex, but
its fundamental cause is posture abnormalities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; the most common causes of musculoskeletal diseases are posture
abnormalities, intervertebral disc degeneration, degenerative spinal diseases, sprain, and
muscle contraction. The transverse abdominis (TVA) muscle stabilizes the lower back. It is
one of the main core stabilizing muscles of the lumbar spine. Kim<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that walking with a straight posture could increase
the muscle tone of the TVA, improve breathing capacity, and relieve low back pain. In
patients with musculoskeletal disorders, it also relieves back pain, strengthens the deep
muscles, and improves breathing. Specifically, the study showed that walking exercise
includes movements that improve muscle tone of the TVA. A previous study showed that the
deep muscles such as the TVA and multifidus may contribute to stability of the spine through
a range of tasks<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thereafter, several
studies have attempted to determine how specific exercises can be used to improve the
ability to contract the multifidus and TVA muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since 1980, muscular strength exercises have been developed to help
rapid recovery of muscle force and pain relief for rehabilitation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, the relationship between exercise and relief of
back pain has been well established. A recent study also established the relationship
between the back pain relief and spinal stabilization<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, changes in walking speed require control from the nerve
muscles, and muscle activity is essentially inherent. If walking speed decreases, the time
to support the feet will increase, and changes in walking can be expected from the synergy
effects of the postural muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nordic
walking is a method of training both the upper body and lower body. The muscles and
endurance of the arms, shoulders, upper body, chest, and abdomen will be improved if walkers
perform Nordic walking using their arms. Nordic walking also effectively helps patients with
pain in lower extremity joints or muscle weakening<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study conducted in a hospital that specializes in
the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain, lumbar stabilization exercise was conducted to
strengthen the abdominal muscles in order to stabilize the spine. Such exercise not only
yielded lumber stabilization, but also led to harmonious muscle activities with the TVA and
diaphragm<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jeong<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that spinal stabilization exercise increases spine
stability and decreases low back pain. In addition, Park<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> found that lumbar stabilization exercise may help in effectively
relieving back pain and that a good posture could help prevent low back pain. Previous
studies have indicated that aerobic exercise could be especially beneficial in relieving low
back pain in elderly people with obesity and arthritis. Aerobic exercise has been shown to
be beneficial for the elderly with low back pain. However, very few studies have
investigated whether Nordic walking can alleviate low back pain. Thus, the aim of this study
was to examine whether Nordic walking exercise can relieve low back pain and change the
spine shape in elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen elderly women with chronic low back pain from the N University in Chungcheong-do,
South Korea, were enrolled in this study. The age (mean &#x000b1; SD), height, weight, and body mass
index of the subjects in the lumbar stabilization group 71.80 &#x000b1; 3.64&#x02005;years, 163.00 &#x000b1;
6.59&#x02005;cm, 62.3 &#x000b1; 8.90&#x02005;kg, and 23.4 &#x000b1; 2.85% respectively. Participation in this study was
voluntary.</p><p>The Inbody 720 (Biospace, Seoul, South Korea) was used to measure the body composition of
the subjects, and the Formetric 4D (DIERS, International GmbH, Schlangenbad, Germany) was
used for pelvic analysis. Weight, body fat, and lean body mass were measured with InBody 3.0
(Biospace) by using the direct segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis
method for body composition measurement. To measure three-dimensional trunk vertebrae
images, pelvis obliquity, and static balance ability, a pressure footstool (Pedoscan; DIERS)
and trunk measurement system (Formetric 4D, DIERS), which is a 3D image-processing apparatus
with a high resolution for the vertebrae that was used in the studies of Lippold et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and Schroder<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, were used in this study. These devices perform analyses
automatically. First, the curves on the surface of the back are analyzed to find a symmetric
line. This line is quite similar to the line that connects the spinous processes with each
other. Thereafter, the surface of the back is analyzed, and four anatomical peaks, that is,
VP (C7), SP (sacrum point), and two dimples (DL and DR) are automatically found accordingly.
The conditions of the pelvis were analyzed based on the symmetric line and anatomical points
found as such to measure and analyze the lateral slope of the pelvis, the anterior/posterior
slope of the pelvis, trunk rotation, trunk length, the lateral slope of the sagittal plane,
and the lateral slope of the coronal plane. The participants were asked to walk in an
upright posture, with their head upright and looking forward. The Nordic poles were held
close to the body. When a foot was moved forward, the arm on the other side lifted the
Nordic pole and moved it forward. The participants were using the Nordic pole when walked on
the track with their arms lifted above their shoulders. They wore shoes when walking; the
type of shoe was irrelevant. During weeks 1 to 6, the walking speed was set to the average
(5&#x02013;6&#x02005;km/h) of the speeds at which the subjects could comfortably walk 20 laps around a 200-m
track in a 40-m period. The exercise intensity prescribed by Karvonen&#x02019;s equation was set at
a target heart rate of 50 to 60% with a 6-week exercise-monitoring arrangement. During weeks
7 to 12, the speed of the walking was set to the average (6&#x02013;7&#x02005;km/h) of the speeds at which
the subjects could walk 24 laps around a 200-m track in a 40-m track in a 40-min period. The
exercise intensity prescribed by Karvonen&#x02019;s equation was set at a target heart rate of
60&#x02013;70% with a 6-week exercise-monitoring arrangement.</p><p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 18.0) was used for data analysis. We
conducted a series of 3 measurements for each participant including the following 5 spine
parameters and pain parameter: trunk length vertebra prominens (VP)-midpoint between lumbar
dimples (DM), trunk imbalance VP-DM, pelvic tilt dimple left-dimple right (DL-DR), pelvic
torsion DL-DR, lateral deviation VP-DM, and a visual analog pain scale (VAS). These
parameters were assessed before the study in all participants (pre-test). Subsequently, the
6-week phases began, and these parameters were measured again in all participants at the
same time of day (mid-term test). At the end of study, these parameters were measured once
more in all participants (post-test). The date were calculated by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey&#x02019;s test to compare the different measurements. The level
of statistical significance was set as a p-value of 0.05.</p><p>All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent

Helsinki.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>One-way ANOVA was used to determine any significant differences between the means of trunk

responses for brisk walking and Nordic walking in nonobese sedentary women and found that
sciatica decreased after training with Nordic walking. Reuter et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effects of a flexibility and relaxation
program, normal walking, and Nordic walking on walking speed, stride length, and stride
length variability in Parkinson disease patients and found that low back, hand, and leg pain
were alleviated in all groups. Strength and muscular power were found to be important
factors for maintaining functional abilities that allow people to perform activities of
independent living. However, muscle strength gradually declined and the decline accelerated
further with age; in particular, lower body muscle strength decreased dramatically. Weakness
of lower body muscles was associated with walking speed in the elderly and weakened the
lumber region, which could lead to development of a bad posture. Weakness of the lumbar
muscle strength was maintained spine stability during static and dynamic movement and, at
the same time, the decrease of lumbar muscle strength declined spine stability due to the
imbalance of lumbar extensor and flexor strength. Timothy et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that the use of Nordic walking poles increased
oxygen consumption, heart rate, and calorie expenditure as compared with regular walking.
Moreover, the use of walking poles might benefit the elderly, individuals with orthopedic
limitations, and individuals with balance problems by increasing stability and reducing
loading. Famsworth and Burtscher<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> showed
that use of Nordic walking poles resulted in use of the upper extremities together with the
lower extremities and, therefore, improved muscle strength and body balance. In a study
involving 14 elderly women aged &#x0003e;65&#x02005;years with chronic degenerative knee arthritis,
Hong<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that pain reduced
significantly when abdominal exercise, lower body muscle exercise, and balance training were
performed for 45 to 60&#x02005;min per week (3 times a week) for 8 weeks. Roddy et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that aerobic walking and
home-based quadriceps strengthening exercises reduced pain and disability in patients with
knee osteoarthritis. In a 3-month program, Fisher et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effects of a quantitative progressive exercise muscle
rehabilitation program on knee osteoarthritis in 40 elderly persons (20 men and 20 women)
chosen from a group of volunteers (N = 437). Applied strength, endurance, and angular
velocity were measured, and the results showed that the program participants improved
difficulties form the step up and decreased their pain by more than 30%. Nordic walking
causes muscle activation that has a lower extremity effect<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result of this study shown, the muscles around the spine
which was is aligned and left-right balance in equilibrium.</p><p>The current study employed power walking exercise using Nordic poles for elderly women with
chronic back pain. Our results showed that low back pain decreased because the upper
extremities were used together with the lower extremities during the exercises performed
using the Nordic poles (neutral position). Nordic walking using the poles was a full-body
exercise, and it developed the upper and lower body muscles simultaneously. This exercise
strengthened the paraspinal muscles and enabled the participants to maintain a steady
position for a long period, because the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, and sensory
nervous system were used together. This exercise can improve muscle strength and muscle
endurance and consequently could be useful for recovering the normal angle balance of the
trunk and relieve pain. In this study, the effect of pain reduction in the muscle from the
enhancements and the reduction of the weight load reduces the pain as a result of the
normalization of the spine in misalignment displacement. We believe that intermittent use,
but not in lame kink patients (intermittent claudication patients), of Nordic pole walking
on applying for research<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> the distance
from the pain (claudication distance) and the maximum walking distance showed an increase in
satisfaction and this is not corporal as a result of a decrease in the burden and pain
caused by stress.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>GO</given-names></name></person-group>: Walking.
