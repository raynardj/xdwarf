However, most of these programmes ignore that, apart from the direct action of genes on such traits, parents, as contributors of offspring environment, can influence offspring performance through indirect parental effects (when parental genotype and phenotype exerts environmental influences on offspring phenotype independently of additive genetic effects). Using quantitative genetic models, we estimated the additive genetic variance for juvenile survival in a population of the endangered Cuvier's gazelle kept in captivity since 1975. The dataset analyzed included performance recording for 700 calves and a total pedigree of 740 individuals. Results indicated that in this population juvenile survival harbors significant additive genetic variance. The estimates of heritability obtained were in general moderate (0.115&#x02013;0.457) and not affected by the inclusion of inbreeding in the models. Maternal genetic contribution to juvenile survival seems to be of major importance in this gazelle's population as well. Indirect genetic and indirect environmental effects assigned to mothers (i.e., maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects) roughly explain a quarter of the total variance estimated for the trait analyzed. These findings have major evolutionary consequences for the species as show that offspring phenotypes can evolve strictly through changes in the environment provided by mothers. They are also relevant for the captive breeding programme of the species. To take into account, the contribution that mothers have on offspring phenotype through indirect genetic effects when designing pairing strategies might serve to identify those females with better ability to recruit, and, additionally, to predict reliable responses to selection in the captive population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Gazella cuvieri</italic></kwd><kwd>heritability</kwd><kwd>indirect parental effects</kwd><kwd>juvenile survival</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Juvenile survival is a critical component of population dynamics. In endangered species managed through captive breeding programmes, the survival of juveniles is crucial for population viability. These conservation programmes focus mainly on the preservation of genetic variability to avoid any negative impact of inbreeding. The genetic effect of inbreeding is the inbreeding depression: the decrease of the individual fitness through reduced fecundity, offspring viability, and individual survivorship (Charlesworth and Charlesworth <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Falconer and Mackay <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Thus, management of endangered species in captivity tends to minimize mating between relatives to maximize individual fitness and maintain population viability in the long term. This procedure assumes that the improvement of fitness or the threats to fitness are only determined by the probability of individuals carrying identical alleles by descent in a given gene. As neutral markers are assumed to be good indicators for homozygosity, most genetic surveys of endangered populations have been carried out using such molecular tools (Ruiz-L&#x000f3;pez et al. <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Godinho et al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) even though they could be poor predictors of genetic diversity in many population scenarios (Hansson and Westerberg <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Undoubtedly, traits of greatest concern in the conservation of evolutionary potential show quantitative variation among individuals (Frankham et al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Garcia-Gonzalez et al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Components of quantitative genetic variation determine the ability to undergo adaptive evolution and the effects of inbreeding on reproductive fitness (Frankham et al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Approaches based on the resemblance of relatives can be used to determine whether endangered populations still show significant additive genetic variation (Falconer and Mackay <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Narrow-sense heritability (<italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>), defined as the proportion of total phenotypic variance that can be ascribed to additive genetic variance (Falconer and Mackay <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), is the most common within-population measure of genetic diversity used for complex traits (see Charmantier and Garant <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Boulding <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; for reviews). Theory predicts a reduction of heritability after several generations of inbreeding (Falconer and Mackay <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Heritability, which determines the evolutionary potential of a quantitative trait (Charmantier and Garant <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), has been estimated for several life-history traits in wild populations (e.g., Kruuk et al. <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; R&#x000e9;ale and Festa-Bianchet <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Wilson et al. <xref rid="b80" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Johnston et al. <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, reports in the literature including estimates of heritability for life-history traits in captive populations of endangered mammals are scant (Pelletier et al. <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), particularly in ungulates (Ricklefs and Cadena <xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Juvenile survival, an obvious key life-history trait, has been studied in polygynous mammals, including ungulates. This trait is affected by different factors such as birth weight (Singer et al. <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), sex (Clutton-Brock et al. <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), litter composition (Burfening <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), maternal characteristics (Pluh&#x000e1;&#x0010d;ek et al. <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), demographic parameters (Gaillard et al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), and environmental factors (Singer et al. <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).</p><p>In most breeding programmes of endangered species, approaches for the preservation of genetic variability ignore that apart from heredity, parents, as part of the environment that offspring perceive, can influence their progeny through parental effects. Following Wolf and Wade (<xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), parental effects represent the influence of parent's genotype and phenotype to their offspring phenotype, independent of additive genetic effects (Kruuk and Hadfield <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). When there is variation in the quality of the environment provided by the parents and if that variation reflects genetic differences among individuals, then the environment is partially heritable through the action of these parental effects. These &#x02018;indirect genetic effects&#x02019; (<italic>sensu</italic> Wolf et al. <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) are named indirect because the genes leading to the effects are expressed in the parent, not in the individual whose phenotype is being measured (Garcia-Gonzalez and Simmons <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). &#x02018;Indirect environmental effects&#x02019; (<italic>sensu</italic> Wolf et al. <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) may also occur when nongenetic (i.e., environmental) influences on the phenotype of one individual (parents) have indirect effects on the phenotype of another individual (offspring; Rositer <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The assessment of both genetic and environmental indirect effects has major evolutionary implications and is relevant to captive breeding, as maternal effects include the genetic ability and the nongenetic abilities and strategies available to mothers to influence offspring phenotype, with potentially large-scale demographic results (Mosseu and Fox <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Jones <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Marshall and Uller <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; R&#x000e4;s&#x000e4;nen and Kruuk <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Information on captive animals is recorded in species-specific databases (called studbooks), representing a wealth of invaluable untapped data for quantitative genetic approaches, as they contain detailed pedigree information rarely available for wild populations (Pelletier et al. <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In this study, we used the information recorded in the International Cuvier's Gazelle Studbook to analyze calf survival in the largest captive population of this species, which has been maintained at La Hoya Experimental Field Station (Almer&#x000ed;a, Spain) for over 35 years. We ran genetic models on this long-term dataset, which while adjusting for systematic environmental effects, took into account the major components of phenotypic variance, the additive genetic component and parental effects. Understanding them and ascertaining their importance to individual fitness requires the implementation of a variance components approach that can separate additive genetic and environmental effects on the phenotype of focal individuals, as they might have evolutionary consequences for the long-term sustainability of the captive population.</p><p><italic>Gazella cuvieri</italic> (Ogilby <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">1841</xref>), a Sahelo-Saharan species, has declined dramatically since the 1950s (Beudels et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and only a few small isolated populations seem to remain in its range (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria), apparently due to excessive hunting, anthropogenic barriers, and habitat degradation (Beudels et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Its captive breeding program began at &#x02018;La Hoya&#x02019; Experimental Field Station (EEZA-CSIC) in Almer&#x000ed;a in 1975 from four founders (one male and three females; Moreno and Espeso <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). For this extremely bottlenecked population, one would expect small additive genetic variation for a life-history trait such as juvenile survival (Price and Schluter <xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>), and consequently, (1) a decrease in the response to selection (natural or artificial) for this trait after several generations of inbreeding (Falconer and Mackay <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and (2) inbreeding depression, as found by several authors for this fitness trait in this population (Alados and Esc&#x000f3;s <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Cassinello <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In this study, we verify these expectations. Moreover, the effect of additive genetic variance on phenotypic variation is compared with the contribution of indirect genetic and environmental effects. We also discuss the relative importance of these two drivers of phenotypic variance for the viability of this captive population of endangered Cuvier's gazelles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Cuvier's gazelle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>) is a medium-sized, sexually dimorphic gazelle. The average body mass of adult females is over 26 kg while that of adult males is about 34 kg. Females are fertile at about 8&#x02013;9 months and males at 12&#x02013;13 months. The gestation period is about 5.5 months. Twins represent up to 39% of births in this polygynous species (Moreno and Espeso <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). At European level, its population is managed through an Endangered Species Programme (EEP) that maintains currently a self-sustaining population. Six institutions (Espeso and Moreno <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) participate in this EEP, with La Hoya Experimental Field Station (EEZA-CSIC) housing the largest population (currently over 140 individuals). As a general rule, animals at &#x02018;La Hoya&#x02019; are maintained in breeding groups formed by one adult male and five to eight adult females. The adult male is removed from its breeding herd when the first calf is born in the herd. This is the recommended procedure in Cuvier's gazelle EEP husbandry guidelines (Moreno and Espeso <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) to avoid the same male to mate the same females in two consecutive breeding seasons.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Juvenile of Cuvier's gazelle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ece30004-4117-f1"/></fig><p>Data for the analyses were extracted from the studbook (Espeso and Moreno <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

In captive populations, as well as in natural ones, the highest mortality occurs among juveniles (Ralls et al. <xref rid="b67" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Kirkwood et al. <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Debyser <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), and in our species mostly up to one month of age (Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The trait characterizes the ability of a calf to survive during the period of strict lactation and takes a dichotomous form: live calf (1) and dead calf (0).</p><p>Available data were edited to remove records in which calf death was due to management (approximately 0.05% of the total deaths), including traumatisms and injuries due to intraspecific agonistic behavior with adults in the herd. The final dataset analyzed consisted of 700 Cuvier's gazelle calf studbook records (Espeso and Moreno <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These included all births at &#x02018;La Hoya&#x02019; Experimental Field Station from 1977 to 2012 (an average of 20 offspring per year was recorded). A total of 40 animals without records were included in the pedigree.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminology</title><p>The present analysis involves the main following effects:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Direct genetic effects (<italic>u</italic>), that is, the variation of a quantitative trait explained by the genotype of the individual on which performance is recorded.

The difference between &#x02018;systematic&#x02019; and &#x02018;random&#x02019; effects in a Bayesian context is that the a priori function of the former (that from where the effects of the marginal posterior distribution is sampled) is a flat, uniform function, while the a priori function for random effects is Gaussian.</p></sec><sec><title>Main models</title><p>Juvenile survival is a discrete, dichotomous trait. The estimates of genetic parameters in dichotomous traits may depend on the population mean for the trait and, theoretically, threshold models would better account for the probabilistic structure of categorical data than linear models do (Gianola and Foulley <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Weller and Gianola <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). But according to several studies in livestock (Goyache et al. <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Cervantes et al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), when databases are small there is little incentive for the use of threshold models over linear models, especially with respect to prediction ability. So in this study, genetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian procedure applied to linear mixed models (Altarriba et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), and these models being classified according to the statistical assumptions on the trait as:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Continuous (C) model assuming that the analyzed trait was a continuous variable with normal distribution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Threshold (T) model, also called probit, (Gianola <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Gianola and Foulley <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Sorensen and Gianola <xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) that theoretically would fit the discrete probabilistic nature of the data better. Under this model, it is assumed that an underlying nonobservable variable exists defining the different categories of the categorical trait if this underlying variable exceeds a particular threshold value.</p></list-item></list><p>We first analyzed juvenile survival running a complete reference model (equation 1) where offspring survival is treated as a trait of the calf as well as of the mother and of the father; that it, we run a model including all the possible random effects.

As inbreeding influence is theoretically defined on nonadditive genetics influence, it is supposed that its effect when fitted as a systematic effect would remove part of the residual variance while keeping the same additive genetic component. Therefore, an increase in heritability would be expected in that scenario. Taking this into account, different models were fitted to ascertain the possible influence of inbreeding on the <italic>Gazella cuvieri</italic> genetic background. Then, models described above were also classified according to the assessment made regarding the influence of inbreeding on the trait as:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Model I: Run without fitting the inbreeding coefficient of the individual producing data in the model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Model II: Run with the inclusion of the inbreeding coefficient of the individual (F<sub>i</sub>) producing data in the model both as a linear and a quadratic covariate.

Therefore, a number of complementary models were fitted as well to find out the likely influence of the mother, the father, or of both parents in this phenotypic trait of their offspring. A full description of the complementary models fitted, and their results are given in the Supplementary Material and in Tables S1 and S2.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All estimations were carried out in a Bayesian frame using the TM program (Legarra <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).

At present, cross-validation (Efron and Tibshirani <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) is considered the best method for checking model prediction ability (Arlot and Celisse <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As results found when using quantitative models are known to be model dependent as well as database dependent, changes in both the effects included in the model fitted and the size (or structure) of the database analyzed affect predictive power. When the same database is analyzed, a given model may fit better to data. However, when the goal is to predict performance, it must be ensured that the prediction ability of such model does not drop when the database changes. The most common approach to maximizing predictive power is to: (1) Create different random subsets from a given database, (2) Carry out the analyses excluding one of the subsets created, and then (3) Predict the performance of the excluded subset using the results of the analyses. When this &#x02018;cross-validation&#x02019; procedure is repeated a number of times for each model, the correlation between the predicted and real performance data can be straightforwardly used to compare models for their prediction ability. The use of cross-validation as the selection criterion has an additional benefit. As this procedure is simply based on the correlation between real (removed) data and the corresponding predicted data, the criterion is free of parametric assumptions. This approach can be applied directly to a wide variety of models with which the predictive power of continuous vs. threshold models can be compared.</p><p>To carry out cross-validation, we randomly removed half of the records of the last 5 years of birth (reference population), the genetic parameters reestimated running the models solved without them, and the removed records estimated according to the obtained solutions. The solutions obtained for the records removed were compared to the real performance data via classical correlation to assess the predictive ability of the model. Then, the correlation (r) between the real removed record and the continuous solution (not rounded estimated record in the continuous models and the underlying variable in the threshold models) was computed. To avoid sampling bias, each model was rerun for 20 random samples and the correlation averaged. Once the best model was chosen, additive genetic values were averaged within year of birth to explore signs of genetic trend of the trait.</p><p>When the best model had been selected by cross-validation, inferences about systematic effects were carried out in a Bayesian context. Therefore, as marginal posterior distributions are available, inferences can be performed in terms of probability of the parameter being located between arbitrary values. In this case, inferences were provided in terms of probability of some desired parameters being higher than 0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Systematic effects</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref> gives information on the solutions found for the major systematic effects included in the linear Calf-dam model.

An understanding of the relative influence of direct (additive genetic) versus indirect (parental) effects underlying this fundamental life-history trait is essential to predict the strength and direction of the evolution of this captive population. In this extremely bottlenecked population, the heritability of juvenile survival is 0.36 (with 98% of probability of being higher than 0.05), which suggests that a non-negligible phenotypic variation observed in this fitness trait is ascribed to additive genetic variance. There are also indirect parental (mainly maternal) effects in this trait which may produce phenotypic resemblance between relatives equivalent to or even greater than that due to the additive genetic variance. Thus, genes influencing juvenile survival are not only those expressed in the individual (directly inherited from calf's parents), but also those of an interacting phenotype, its mother. This means that a calf's phenotype may also evolve through changes in the environment provided by its mother.</p><sec><title>Systematic effects and permanent maternal environmental effects on juvenile survival</title><p>Juvenile survival in Cuvier's gazelle is highly influenced by both mother parity and mother age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>), which is consistent with results from other nongenetic studies carried out with this (Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and other mammal species (C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; and Festa-Bianchet <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Pluh&#x000e1;&#x0010d;ek et al. <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Offspring survival was relatively low when mothers were young and primiparous (62% at 1 year old), substantially increased when mothers were mid-aged (up to 87% at 8.5 years old) and decreased again in senescent mothers. The optimal age of mothers for calf survival was from 7.5 to 9.5 years old. Breeding before reaching adult body size represents a cost in terms of calf survival added to inexperience on primiparous mothers and decline in offspring survival found in oldest mothers might be the consequence of a decreased body condition due to reproductive senescence (Berub&#x000e9; et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; and Festa-Bianchet <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Ericsson et al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>Litter composition (a factor that captures sex and litter size) influences infant survival as well in Cuvier's gazelles. The highest mortality was found for single male offspring (M) and for offspring with a male cotwin [F(M); M(M); see also Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. Our results in a captive Cuvier's population support findings by other authors that female calves are less costly to produce and rear than males, even if they are twins (Moreno et al. <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Maternal permanent environmental effect also explains a proportion of the variance of juvenile survival. The data fit for the Calf-dam-permanent models were slightly lower than for the Calf-dam models. The small size of the available dataset led to poorer performance of the models fitted as the number of effects included increased. Although these maternal effects do not contribute directly to the evolutionary response to selection (Wolf et al. <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) they might have important management consequences in captive breeding of threatened species as it might help the EEP's manager to identify those dams providing better environment to their offspring, offering a complementary criteria when arranging breeding herds. For example, the manager might detect those mothers more successful at preventing offspring death because they provide more care, and mate them preferably to others tending more to lose offspring.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic nature of juvenile survival</title><p>Heritability (<italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) of juvenile survival in the Cuvier's gazelle was moderate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), but much higher than estimates of <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> in captive rhesus macaques (Gagliardi et al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It was also higher than estimates of <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> for other life-history traits in wild red deer (Kruuk et al. <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and other mammals (Holt et al. <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Contrary to expectations, our results suggest that some significant amount of additive genetic variance is maintained within this captive population for a character closely related to fitness, revealing that this quantitative trait can potentially still evolve (Charmantier and Garant <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Moreover, we found that heritability estimates (<italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) were higher when the trait was considered only as a calf trait than with the inclusion of maternally related random effects in the models fitted, suggesting that the additive genetic variances were overestimated due to previously unaccounted for genetic and environmental maternal effects. In our analyses, the maternal variance components indicated that mothers vary in their influence on the survival of their offspring. The models fitted allowed us to separate maternal variance from offspring additive variance. As maternal effects were consistent across models, we infer that indirect maternal effects operate on juvenile survival through maternal selection. When maternal genetic effects are not negligible, response to selection depends not only on direct, but also on the additive genes underlying the maternal genetic effect (<italic>m</italic>), which can result in accelerated, or dampened response to selection (Wolf et al. <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Here, looking at the standard deviations of its posterior marginal distribution, the genetic correlation estimated between <italic>u</italic> and <italic>m</italic> was clearly nonsignificant regardless of the model used. Hence, the use of individual additive genetic values for survival as criteria to form breeding herds in this captive population will make sense only if the maternal genetic effects are considered. By doing this, juvenile mortality will tend to decrease in the population thereby increasing its long-term viability.</p><p>A positive change in genetic trend was thus observed in calves and mothers, which shows selection for juvenile survival over time. These results indicate that (1) the Cuvier's Gazelle captive breeding program is effective in achieving genetic improvement in this fitness trait despite increased inbreeding since it began in 1975 (Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and (2) that genetic changes have occurred in response to natural selection attesting to the evolutionary potential of this captive population.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of inbreeding</title><p>The inclusion of inbreeding in the estimation models (Appendix S1) did not affect the estimates of heritability, suggesting the maintenance of genetic variability in our population. Although a potential change in variance components dependant on inbreeding has not been modelled, if such relationship exists, residual variance would have decreased and heritability would have increased. Even when inbreeding increased, there was no depression, as juvenile survival progressively increased over the 35-year study period. The low impact of inbreeding depression observed in our study (see also Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) could be a consequence of a slow rate of inbreeding in the Cuvier's gazelle population in the past, which may have allowed natural selection to progressively purge some of the negative consequences of inbreeding (Ballou <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), or it could just be a specific feature of the species, where the consequences of inbreeding seem to be less striking than in others (Ballou <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Improvements in husbandry may lead to higher average survival in captive populations in spite of an increase in inbreeding as well (Kalinowski et al. <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Although we cannot exclude this possibility, the importance of maternal effects suggests that the increase in calf survival is not solely due to husbandry improvements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Insights for conservation</title><p>For threatened and endangered species, coordinated captive breeding programs such as the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) represent the only way to rear and maintain the sustained populations that ensure their survival (Magin et al. <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Russello and Amato <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, captive breeding populations are also often observed to be in serious demographic decline. Although their managers have a variety of breeding schemes for maintaining their genetic diversity and alleviating inbreeding depression if necessary, achieving sustainable population sizes of these generally low-founder populations is usually difficult (Kleiman et al. <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In this study, we have focused on a key fitness trait, juvenile survival, which represents the greatest contribution to fitness in both captive and natural populations (Houde et al. <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Our results underscore that, apart from direct genetic transmission, parents (mainly mothers) contribute to their offspring through indirect (genetic and environmental) effects, these maternal effects increasing the potential of this population to respond to selection on offspring survival. So, to take into account maternal contribution in pairing strategies of captive bred endangered species might be of great importance in predicting a reliable response to selection, as well as to identify those individuals with better ability to recruit. Even more, if traits expressed during social interactions (e. g., mother&#x02013;offspring interaction) evolved more rapidly than other type of traits (Moore et al. <xref rid="b100" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), to consider their likely effects is crucial when arranging pairing strategies as they might be responsible at least partially for the rapid adaptation to captivity described for some species (Frankham and Loebel <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Woodworth et al. <xref rid="b83" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Heath et al. <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kraaijeveld-Smit et al. <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was partly funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under project GCL 2008-00562/BOS and by the European Regional Development Fund.
