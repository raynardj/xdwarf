PDI binds NPs differentially, and co-localizes with GC-A, GC-B. These results suggest that membrane-bound PDI physically interacts with natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) and their receptors (GC-A and GC-B) and is an important allosteric modulation of this cGMP system.</p><p>In the current studies, cGMP generation by NPs in HMCs, HASMCs, and HUVECs was decreased significantly (up to &#x0223c;90%) when PDI activity was inhibited by bacitracin, RL90, or siRNA-mediated knockdown. The greater effect seen with bacitracin compared to RL90 or siRNA knockdown is likely due to its broader range of inhibitory effects on other thiol isomerases. In contrast, LLC-PK1 cells, which lack detectable PDI expression, displayed no significant change of cGMP generation with bacitracin. Moreover, addition of purified PDI to LLC-PK1 cells increased the ability of NP to stimulate cGMP, suggesting that PDI activity, although modulatory of NP function, is not required in NP stimulated cGMP. In addition, by utilizing multiple cell types that express different levels of GC-A and GC-B. and by immunoprecipitation and immunostaining of HMCs and HUVECs, we demonstrate that PDI has similar effects on CG-A and GC-B, revealing PDI may modulate the cGMP action of all NPs (i.c. ANP, BNP and CNP).</p><p>PDI has an essential role in the oxidative folding and chaperone-mediated quality control of proteins in secretory pathways. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Freedman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> Previous studies have demonstrated that PDI is involved in a wide range of physiological and disease processes. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Benham1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> Toldo and colleagues identified PDI as a cardioprotective factor in cardiomyocyte ischemia due to its ability to relieve ER stress and prevent accumulation of unfolded proteins. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Toldo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> Beside its function within the ER, PDI also has been demonstrated to catalyzes the isomerization of disulfide bonds of cell surface proteins. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112986-Kaiser1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112986-Laurindo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112986-Dusterhoft1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> The interaction changes the protein conformation of cell surface proteins resulting in the alternation of their functions.</p><p>The important role of the disulfide bonds in the natriuretic peptide receptors is well established. The extracellular domain (ECD) (peptide binding domain) of GC-A contains six cysteines which form three disulfide bonds. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Miyagi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> The binding of ANP to the ECD affects GC-A homodimer quaternary structure causing the two juxtamembrane domains in the dimer to translate in opposite directions. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> Misono et al have proposed that this ligand-induced rotation mechanism in the juxtamembrane region triggers transmembrane signal transduction. <xref rid="pone.0112986-Misono1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> These studies indicate that the quaternary structure of ECD is critical for the function (ligand binding and activation) of natriuretic peptide receptors. The internal cysteines of the ECD formed disulfide bonds are the main forces to maintain and alter the molecular structure of the receptors.</p><p>As such, we would speculate that the conformation of these critical domains is modulated by thiol isomerases including cell surface PDI which would explain our experimental findings. Our data suggest that PDI co-localizes with the NP receptors (GC-A and GC-B) and is capable of binding to NP ligands (such as ANP, BNP and CNP) allowing for a modulation of its effects. The nature of this relationship and its stoichiometry is beyond the scope of this current paper and will be a focus of future studies. However, our data suggest that this modulatory role of PDI is not limited to any given NP ligand or GC-A or GC-B alone but is more generalizable. These findings could aid in further understanding the modulation of NP action in cardiovascular and renal diseases in which alterations in PDI activity could impact NP activation of cGMP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112986.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>A.
