The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether glutamate receptors of the NMDA and AMPA/kainate type are involved in myenteric neuron cell damage induced by I/R. Primary cultured rat myenteric ganglia were exposed to sodium azide and glucose deprivation (<italic>in vitro</italic> chemical ischemia). After 6 days of culture, immunoreactivity for NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors subunits, GluN<sub>1</sub> and GluA<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub>, GluK<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> respectively, was found in myenteric neurons. In myenteric cultured ganglia, in normal metabolic conditions, -AP5, an NMDA antagonist, decreased myenteric neuron number and viability, determined by calcein AM/ethidium homodimer-1 assay, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, measured with hydroxyphenyl fluorescein. CNQX, an AMPA/kainate antagonist exerted an opposite action on the same parameters. The total number and viability of myenteric neurons significantly decreased after I/R. In these conditions, the number of neurons staining for GluN<sub>1</sub> and GluA<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub> subunits remained unchanged, while, the number of GluK<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>-immunopositive neurons increased. After I/R, -AP5 and CNQX, concentration-dependently increased myenteric neuron number and significantly increased the number of living neurons. Both -AP5 and CNQX (100&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;M) decreased I/R-induced increase of ROS levels in myenteric ganglia. On the whole, the present data provide evidence that, under normal metabolic conditions, the enteric glutamatergic system exerts a dualistic effect on cultured myenteric ganglia, either by improving or reducing neuron survival via NMDA or AMPA/kainate receptor activation, respectively. However, blockade of both receptor pathways may exert a protective role on myenteric neurons following and I/R damage. The neuroprotective effect may depend, at least in part, on the ability of both receptors to increase intraneuronal ROS production.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported with grants from the Italian Ministry of Research and University (PRIN 2008) and from grants from the University of Insubria and of Pavia.

Damage to the intestine may initially and transiently involve the mucosal layer inducing epithelial shedding, bacterial translocation from the lumen into the gut wall, impairment of nutrient absorption, and prolonged reduction in intestinal blood flow <xref rid="pone.0113613-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Lindestrm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Increasing evidence is, however, available to suggest that intrinsic neuronal circuitries may be damaged following I/R: some neurons may die, while others may undergo changes lasting for many weeks after the injury <xref rid="pone.0113613-Lindestrm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113613-Rivera2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Investigations on the effects of I/R injury on enteric neurons have evidenced changes both in the morphology, distribution and function of some neuronal pathways, including nitrergic, glutamatergic and peptidergic (e.g. VIP and SP) transmission <xref rid="pone.0113613-Rivera1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Rivera2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Calcina1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113613-Giaroni1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism/s underlying such changes. In the central nervous system (CNS), glutamate plays a key role in the neuronal damage following an I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0113613-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. After ischemia, enhancement of extracellular glutamate concentration causes a sustained activation of NMDA ionotropic receptors leading to a rise of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>++</sup>. The increase of free intracellular Ca<sup>++</sup> initiates a cascade of metabolic events, including production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death <xref rid="pone.0113613-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Disruption of Ca<sup>++</sup> regulatory mechanisms and generation of ROS have been correlated with motility changes occurring during re-oxygenation after hypoxic insults in the gut <xref rid="pone.0113613-Bielefeldt1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Accumulation of nitrosylated protein aggregates resulting from the reaction between nitric oxide (NO) and ROS has been suggested to participate to degeneration of nitrergic neurons following an <italic>in vivo</italic> I/R damage in the mouse gut <xref rid="pone.0113613-Rivera2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Glutamate represents an enteric neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, selectively concentrated in terminal axonal varicosities from where it can be released after application of an appropriate stimulus <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giuliani1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Kirchgessner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Glutamate ionotropic receptors of the NMDA and AMPA type are abundantly expressed on enteric neurons <xref rid="pone.0113613-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and participate to the regulation of both motor and secretory functions of the gut <xref rid="pone.0113613-Kirchgessner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giarossni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

In the present study, to further investigate the mechanisms underlying glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in myenteric neurons following an I/R insult, we evaluated whether ionotropic glutamate receptors of the NMDA and AMPA/kainate type are involved in myenteric neuron cell damage induced by I/R.

Principles of good laboratory animal care were followed and animal experimentation was in compliance with specific national and international laws and regulations. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Insubria. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation and approximately 20 cm of the distal small intestine, 5 cm oral to the ileo-caecal junction, were rapidly excised and rinsed with a physiological ice-cold Tyrode's solution (composition (mM): 137 NaCl; 2.68 KCl; 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O; 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.47 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 11.9 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; 5.6 glucose). Longitudinal muscle with attached myenteric ganglia (LMMP) were stripped from the whole intestinal wall without penetrating the gut mucosa, thereby avoiding contamination by faecal material. LMMP segments were put in a cold Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> free-Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Euroclone, Milano, Italy) and mechanically minced with small scissors. Incubation in HBSS containing collagenase II (1.5 mg/ml) and protease (1.25 mg/ml) followed for 25 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Digested preparations were then incubated with Trypsin (1.25 mg/ml) and EDTA (0.01%) for 20 min after which time 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added. Cell suspension underwent two consecutive centrifugations at 1500 rpm for 7 min at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by washes in HBSS.

The difference between these observations and our results may rely upon the different antibodies used as well as on different animal models and procedures. The abundance of ionotropic glutamate receptors on myenteric neuron cell culture, in particular of GluN<sub>1</sub>, is in good agreement with immunohistochemistry data obtained in the human colon, guinea pig, rat and mouse ileum <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giuliani1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giaroni1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giarossni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and may reflect the functional relevance of enteric glutamatergic pathways in the regulation of the myenteric neuronal networks. In our model, the ability of both -AP5 and CNQX to concentration-dependently increase neuron count and viability following in vitro I/R, strongly suggests that both NMDA and AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors may be involved in the neuronal damage. In agreement with our observations, in rat primary cortical neurons, enhancement of cytosolic Ca<sup>++</sup> concentration induced by sodium azide treatment was mediated by both NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor activation <xref rid="pone.0113613-Marino1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. During reperfusion, however, -AP5 increased myenteric neuron number only at the lower concentrations tested, while, at the highest concentration tested (1 mM), the antagonist markedly reduced this parameter, probably reflecting a dualistic action, which may be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic in relation to the concentration used. Interestingly, in normal metabolic conditions, -AP5 concentration-dependently reduced myenteric neuron number and viability. As observed in primary cultures of newborn rat cerebellar granule cells, glutamate may exert a trophic action on isolated myenteric ganglia by mediating Ca<sup>++</sup> influx via NMDA receptor activation <xref rid="pone.0113613-Burgoyne1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It is, thus, possible that high concentrations of -AP5 may reduce intracellular Ca<sup>++</sup> levels necessary for myenteric neuron survival during reperfusion. The NMDA receptor is partially inhibited at physiological concentrations by Mg<sup>++</sup> (1 mM) and this block is overcome by depolarisation <xref rid="pone.0113613-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Sensitivity of myenteric neurons to the NMDA receptor antagonist in the presence of Mg<sup>++</sup> might be explained considering that, after 6 days of culture, the resting membrane displays a partially depolarized state, similarly to what observed in immature neurons <xref rid="pone.0113613-Hanani1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, we cannot exclude that in isolated myenteric neurons different GluN subunits may assemble to form a functional heteromeric NMDA receptor displaying low sensitivity to Mg<sup>++</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0113613-Pachernegg1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Following I/R damage, the number of GluN<sub>1</sub> and GluA<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub>, immunopositive neurons did not change with respect to control values, while GluK<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> significantly increased. These data suggest that the neuroprotective action of CNQX may depend, at least in part, upon an increase of GluK<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> receptor availability, while -AP5-mediated neuroprotection may depend upon intracellular mechanism influencing neuronal viability. After <italic>chemical</italic> ischemia, enhancement of extracellular glutamate concentration and sustained activation of NMDA ionotropic receptors induces a rise of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>++</sup>, which on its own initiates a cascade of metabolic events, including production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death <xref rid="pone.0113613-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In isolated myenteric neurons both from control and I/R-treated preparations, ROS levels increased with time, reaching a peak at 180 min and remained stable thereafter. Different hypotheses may be put forward to explain the reduced rate of ROS production in the last hour of incubation, including the ability of ROS species to induce antioxidant enzyme transcription via activation of Nrf2, which represents a possible detoxifying feedback mechanism <xref rid="pone.0113613-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Under normal metabolic conditions, -AP5 at high concentrations increased ROS levels, supporting the hypothesis that the antagonist may exert a toxic effect on myenteric ganglia in culture. CNQX, on opposite, time-dependently decreased ROS production in control preparations, as indicated by the ability of the drug to reduce HPF fluorescence after 3&#x02013;4 h of incubation, suggesting that AMPA/kainate receptors may regulate basal ROS production in myenteric neurons, as already observed in the rat brain <xref rid="pone.0113613-Radenovic1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This observation is in good agreement with the ability of CNQX to concentration-dependently increase both neuron number and viability in isolated myenteric ganglia. After I/R, ROS levels significantly and progressively increased with respect to control values. During reperfusion, at all time points, HPF fluorescence was higher than after chemically-induced ischemia, suggesting that ROS production in myenteric neurons may raise after restoring normal metabolic conditions. Both NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors may contribute to such increase, since both -AP5 and CNQX were able to reduce I/R-induced neuronal ROS, although AMPA/kainate receptors seem to retain a more important role, since CNQX displayed a higher efficacy in reducing this parameter <xref rid="pone.0113613-Iwasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113613-Carriedo2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This data is in line with the increased expression of GluK<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> subunits in myenteric neurons after I/R. In a previous paper, excessive exposure of guinea pig cultured myenteric ganglia to kainic acid has been shown to induce morphological changes and/or disruption in mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that excessive activation of kainate receptors may participate to excitotoxicity in the ENS <xref rid="pone.0113613-Kirchgessner2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The mechanism underlying myenteric neuron sensitivity to AMPA/kainate-mediated injury remains to be elucidated. However, we cannot exclude that, as already suggested for some subpopulations of central neurons, this may be largely attributed to the expression of AMPA/kainate channels with high Ca<sup>++</sup> permeability in myenteric neurons <xref rid="pone.0113613-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In our model, ROS production was measured with HPF, a fluorescent dye which is specific for highly reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxinitrites <xref rid="pone.0113613-Indo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Thrasivoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Since HPF responds primarily to hydroxyl radicals, derived principally from superoxide, our data is indicative of a ROS signal predominantly originating in mithochondrial superoxide. However, the involvement of other oxidative or nitrosative stress species, such as NO, in I/R-induced damage to myenteric neurons in culture cannot be excluded, and requires further investigations <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giaroni2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>From a functional viewpoint, enhancement of the enteric glutamatergic system may induce alterations of enteric neurotransmitter pathways that might contribute to gastrointestinal dismotility associated with the I/R insult. In the guinea pig ileum, during an ischemic episode, excessive glutamate release and the consequent overstimulation of NMDA receptors has been suggested to be at the basis of changes in the regulation of the cholinergic function and may underlay disturbances in the neuro-effector transmission thus disrupting the endogenous rhythm and coordination of motor activity <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giuliani1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113613-Giaroni1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

In this paper we provide direct evidence of a neurotoxic action of both NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors in myenteric neurons after an I/R injury.
