Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash that is similar to measles. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, which results in bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and leakage of blood plasma, or into dengue shock syndrome, in which dangerously low blood pressure occurs. Treatment of acute dengue fever is supportive, with either oral or intravenous rehydration for mild or moderate disease and use of intravenous fluids and blood transfusion for more severe cases. Along with attempts to eliminate the mosquito vector, work is ongoing to develop a vaccine and medications targeted directly at the virus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Dengue fever, also known as breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne infectious tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.

It binds to and enters white blood cells and then reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signalling proteins, including interferons and other cytokines, which are responsible for nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, and muscle pain. In severe infection, virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) may be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities because of endothelial dysfunction. As a result, less blood circulates, and shock may result. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><sec id="S3a"><title>Viral replication.</title><p>Once inside the skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (dendritic cells in the skin that are engaged in surveillance for pathogens).<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The virus enters these cells through binding of viral proteins with membrane proteins on the cells, specifically the C-type lectins known as DC-SIGN, mannose receptors, and C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A).<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> DC-SIGN, a nonspecific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The dendritic cell then moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles associated with the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that then copy the viral RNA and begin to assemble viral particles.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins), and the precursor membrane protein prM is cleaved to its M form. The mature new viruses bud inside the cell and are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce interferon, a cytokine that raises a number of defences against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins (interferon-stimulated genes or ISGs), a process mediated by the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (also known as the JAK-STAT pathway).<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The ISGs also help to activate cells of the adaptive immune system, leading to the generation of antibodies specific for the virus, as well as T cells that directly attack infected cells.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Various antibodies are generated. Some of these antibodies bind tightly to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but others bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="S3b"><title>Severe disease.</title><p>It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement. The exact mechanism behind antibody-dependent enhancement is unclear.
