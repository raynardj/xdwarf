with a foam roller on the reduction of stress by measuring the serum concentration of
cortisol. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this study were healthy females in their
20s. They were divided into the experimental and control groups. Both groups, each
consisting of 12 subjects, were directed to walk for 30 minutes on a treadmill. The
control group rested for 30 minutes of rest by lying down, whereas the experimental group
was performed a 30 minutes of self-myofascial release program. [Results] Statistically
significant levels of cortisol concentration reduction were observed in both the
experimental group, which used the foam roller, and the control group. There was no
statistically significant difference between the two groups. [Conclusion] The
Self-myofascial release induced with a foam roller did not affect the reduction of
stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Myofascial release</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd><kwd>Foam roller</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human body has a mechanism of maintaining internal homeostasis against external
changes. However, stress threatens the mechanism for the maintenance of homeostasis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stress is a non-specific biological reaction, which occurs in response to physical injuries
and stimulations imparted to the body, and it modifies the immune system.</p><p>Stress is determined by mental and physical factors. In particular, physical stress excites
exacerbation of the sympathetic nervous system and increase heartbeat, and imparts
negatively influences on the immune system to a greater extent than mental stress<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, physical stress induces
muscular modification or repetitive strain injuries, causing muscular imbalance and
inflammation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Inflammation in turn
becomes a cause of increased muscular tension and spasms<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscular tension can promote formation of taut bands or trigger
points in the myofascia, which can develop into myofascial pain syndrome<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myofascial pain syndrome creates a vicious
cycle of &#x0201c;pain &#x02212; spasm &#x02212; pain.&#x0201d; If this vicious cycle is not interrupted at an early stage,
it will inevitably become a chronic problem. This vicious cycle of pain leads to
psychological stress, which becomes the cause of continuous pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are a wide range of physiotherapy interventions for physical stress, and, in
particular, myofascial release is an excellent method that can mitigate the damage caused by
physical stress with low-load mechanical stimulation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myofascial release is a method of stretching the myofascial system
with low load over a prolonged period of time in order to enhance the functions of the human
body, reduce pain and secure appropriate muscle length<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myofascial release performed by a therapist induces recovery in the
damaged area of the muscle and reduces inflammation and edema<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is difficult
to perform this therapy alone.</p><p>Recently, a method using a foam roller to induce self-myofascial release has been
introduced<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Preceding studies
conducted on self-myofascial release using a foam roller have mainly focused on the range of
joint movement and changes in posture with the findings evaluated from a biomechanical
perspective<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it has been
asserted that the reliability of the biomechanical measurement is low and the biological
results of mechanical stimulation must be considered<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study measured the serum concentration of
cortisol, a biological factor, to determine whether the mechanical stimulation provided by a
foam roller is effective at reducing stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four healthy females in their 20s were selected as the subjects of this study. The
subjects were randomly and evenly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. All
the subjects were directed to walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes at the normal walking speed
of 1.2 m/s, while wearing high-heeled shoes in order to induce physical stress.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> Sufficient explanation of the experimental
procedure and the purpose of the study was provided to the subjects who signed consent forms
prior to their participation. Then, approval form the Ethics Committee of the Catholic
University of Pusan was acquired (CUPIRB-2013-019).</p><p>After the subjects had walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes, 12 subjects of the
experimental group performed the 30-min myofascial release technique using a foam roller,
while the 12 control group subjects were instructed to rest comfortably on their backs for
30 minutes. During the 30-minute self-myofascial release program, pressure was applied on a
single spot for 30 seconds using the subject&#x02019;s body weight in order to stimulate the
corresponding muscle over a period of 3 to 6 minutes as a means of alleviating muscle
tension in the spine and areas around the 4 limbs. The program was performed as follows:</p><p>Myofascial release of the entire spine, 6 minutes; of the cervix, 6 minutes; of the thorax,
6 minutes; of the quadriceps femoris muscle, 3 minutes; of the hamstring, 3 minutes; of the
tensor fascia latae, 3 minutes; and of the calf muscle, 3 minutes.</p><p>Blood (10&#x02005;ml) was collected from the vein in the forearm of the subjects after they had
completed the walking exercise on the treadmill, and after 30 minutes of myofascial release
with the foam roller (the experimental group) or after 30 minutes of rest (the control
group). All the subjects were instructed to arrive at the laboratory with empty stomach on
the day of the experiment, by fasting from 9 p.m. on the previous day, and they rested for
30 minutes upon arrival at the laboratory. The blood samples were immediately placed in
heparinized tubes and centrifuged for over 15 minutes at the speed of 300&#x02005;rpm. The serum was
separated and stored at a temperature below &#x02212;70&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. Analysis was performed by the Clinical
Pathology Department of the Catholic University of Busan.</p><p>Data were processed using the statistical program SPSS 19.0. For all the measured data, the
mean and standard deviation values were computed for each of the variables. In order to
investigate the effect of the self-myofascial release method using a foam roller on physical
stress, the paired t-test was performed. The independent t-test was performed to verify the
differences between the groups. The statistical significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects of this study are summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group(n=12)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group(n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (y)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.8&#x000b1;1.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5&#x000b1;1.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.5&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.7&#x000b1;1.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157.3&#x000b1;3.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.5&#x000b1;2.7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.

a foam roller on physical stress.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated stress by analyzing catecholamine and cortisol<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Catecholamines, which include norepinephrine and epinephrine, excite
the sympathetic nervous system. However, they have a very short half-life of 1 to 2 minutes,
making their evaluation very difficult<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In contrast, cortisol, which is necessary for the excitation of the sympathetic nervous
system by catecholamines, has a half-life of approximately 20 to 40 minutes; thus, it can be
a reliable index of stress<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, it can be used to indirectly predict the activities of the sympathetic nerves.
Therefore, the concentration of cortisol hormone was measured as the index of stress in this
study.</p><p>In this study, the blood cortisol levels of both the experimental and control groups showed
significant reductions 30&#x02005;min after the completion of treadmill walking. However, there was
no statistically significant difference between the two groups. This can be explained as
follows. First, cortisol, which is a key adrenocortical hormone, has a daily rhythm. Thus,
the cortisol level normally changes throughout the day, with the highest levels being in the
morning and the lowest levels in the evening<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. For more accurate measurement of the cortisol level, it should be
measured twice, at about 8:30 a.m and 4 p.m., the approximate times of maximum and minimum
cortisol secretion. However, in this study, blood was collected only at about 8:30 a.m. when
the cortisol secretion is highest, and this may have masked differences between the 2
groups. Second, the subjects of the control group were instructed to lie down during rest,
and this posture increases cerebral blood flow<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increase in blood flow is known to play a role in reducing
stress<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is possible
that this resulted in levels of cortisol in the control group being similar to those of the
experimental group.</p><p>The blood cortisol level of the experimental group after the application of the foam roller
was lower than that of the control group, but the difference was not significant. We think
that the self-myofascial release technique affected the autonomic nervous system of the
subjects in the experimental group. Schleip asserted that there are &#x0201c;smooth muscle cells&#x0201d; in
the myofascia that contract in addition to becoming tensed<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. These cells are capable of controlling the autonomic nervous
system independent of muscular tension. The self-myofascial release technique used in this
study applies very slow, gradual and deep pressure which we think lowers the activities of
the sympathetic nerves. This effect is achieved by promoting the interstitial receptor
effects that control the autonomic nerves through the stimulation of Ruffini endings<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, we consider the
self-myofascial release technique increased the activation of the parasympathetic nerves,
thereby reducing stress.</p><p>In this study, application of the self-myofascial release technique using a foam roller
after exposure to physical stress resulted in better effects on stress reduction, on
average, than taking a rest, even though there was no significant difference. We consider it
necessary to repeat the experiment with a larger number of subjects in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Cannon</surname><given-names>WB</given-names></name></person-group>: Bodily changes in pain, hunger, fear and rage.
