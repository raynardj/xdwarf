OPN primarily exerts its functions through interaction with integrins via the Arg-Gly-Asp and Ser-Val-Val-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg sequences located in the N-terminal part of the protein. OPN can be polymerized by the cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and polymerization has been shown to enhance the biological activity of OPN. However, little is known about the reactivity and location of the glutamine and lysine residues involved in the TG2-mediated modification of OPN. Here we show that TG2 catalyses the incorporation of 5-(Biotinamido)pentylamine at glutamines in both the N- and C-terminal parts of OPN, whereas TG2 primarily incorporated the glutamine-donor peptide biotinyl-TVQQEL-OH into the C-terminal part of OPN. By mass spectrometric analyses we identified Gln34, Gln42, Gln193 and Gln248 as the major TG2 reactive glutamines in OPN. The distribution of reactive Gln and Lys residues in OPN proved to be important, as the full-length protein but not the physiologically highly active integrin-binding N-terminal part of OPN were able to polymerize in a TG2-mediated reaction. Collectively, these data provide important new molecular knowledge about the mechanism of OPN polymerization.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by The Danish Council for Independent Research &#x02013; Natural Sciences (grant No. 12-126168).

OPN plays critical roles in physiological processes such as inflammation, tumorigenesis, mineralization and tissue remodeling <xref rid="pone.0113650-Sodek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Many of these versatile functions are exerted through interactions with integrin receptors via the RGD motif and a cryptic Ser-Val-Val-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg (SVVYGLR) sequence exposed upon proteolytic cleavage <xref rid="pone.0113650-Sodek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. OPN undergoes many types of post-translational modification such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, proteolytic processing and transglutamination by transglutaminase 2 (TG2) or Factor XIIIa <xref rid="pone.0113650-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Christensen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Prince1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

The significance of OPN glycosylation has not been well described, though a recent study suggests that <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of OPN actually affects the phosphorylation of the protein and hence its interaction with cells <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kariya1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Several matrix metalloproteases as well as plasmin and thrombin cleave OPN close to the RGD-sequence and thereby generates N-terminal fragments that show greater capability to mediate RGD-dependent cell attachment than the full-length protein <xref rid="pone.0113650-Christensen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Agnihotri1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

TG2, also known as tissue type transglutaminase, is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein-cross-linking enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a covalent, &#x003b3;-glutamyl-&#x003b5;-lysyl (isopeptide) bond between specific Lys and Gln residues of its substrate proteins <xref rid="pone.0113650-Lorand1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. TG2 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is implicated in stabilization of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and wound healing processes <xref rid="pone.0113650-Lorand1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. TG2 polymerized OPN has been identified <italic>in vivo</italic> in bone and calcified aorta <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In bone, OPN forms homo-polymeric protein aggregates rather than polymerizing in a heterotypic manner with other proteins <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Such polymerization of OPN increases its collagen binding properties and enhances opsonization facilitated by the protein <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Pedraza1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown increased cell-binding properties of TG2-polymerized OPN compared to monomeric OPN leading to enhanced cell adhesion and migration <xref rid="pone.0113650-Forsprecher1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Higashikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. TG2-catalysed polymerization of OPN can form <italic>de novo</italic> binding sites for integrins, as the &#x003b1;<sub>9</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin binds polymeric OPN independently of the SVVYGLR motif <xref rid="pone.0113650-Nishimichi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0113650-Nishimichi2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These studies indicate that polymerization of OPN is an important regulatory mechanism in OPN's interaction with cells.</p><p>OPN contains several highly conserved Gln and Lys residues in both its N- and C-terminal parts. The conservation of these residues imply that they could be functionally important, as is the case for other highly conserved elements like the integrin-binding sequences, the poly-aspartic region and the sites of phosphorylation, glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kazanecki1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Hitherto only Gln34 and Gln36 in bovine OPN (conserved throughout mammalian species) have been identified as TG2 reactive <xref rid="pone.0113650-Srensen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, OPN-c, a splice variant which does not contain Gln34 and Gln36, can still undergo TG2-mediated polymerization <xref rid="pone.0113650-Nishimichi2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> indicating that there are more reactive Gln residues in OPN. Furthermore, the TG2 reactive Lys residues in OPN have not previously been studied. Thus, only little is known about the reactivity of the Gln and Lys residues involved in the TG2-mediated modification of OPN.</p><p>In this study, we identify the TG2 reactive Gln and Lys residues in both the N- and C-terminal parts of human OPN. The study provides novel structural information about the TG2-mediated polymerization of OPN, and indicates that the N-terminal part of OPN containing both the RGD- and SVYYGLR integrin binding motifs and which has been shown to be important in many physiological processes cannot be polymerized by TG2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Promega.

In order to get more information about which of the identified Gln residues that could be considered as the major TG2 reactive residues, we used two different approaches. Initially, OPN was incubated with 5-(Biotinamido)pentylamine and TG2 for only 15 min followed by nLC-MS/MS analysis as described above. After this short incubation time, only Gln42, Gln193 and Gln248 were labelled with the probe, indicating that these residues are major TG2 reactive sites in OPN (<xref rid="pone-0113650-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In another experiment, OPN was labeled with 5-(Biotinamido)pentylamine for 5 h and the peptides were purified using the monomeric avidin resin and then further fractionated using reverse-phase HPLC.

After longer incubation times, the intra-molecular cross-linked OPN disappeared whereas the polymeric OPN band was still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, lane 3 and 4).</p><fig id="pone-0113650-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113650.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Polymerization of full-length OPN and the N-terminal part of OPN.</title><p>The N-terminal part of recombinant OPN (A), full-length recombinant OPN (B&#x02013;C) and human milk OPN (D) were incubated with TG2 in a 10&#x02236;1 ratio (w/w).

Based on the incorporation of 5-(Biotinamido)pentylamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), it is estimated that the two fragments contain a comparable number of reactive Gln residues. By using highly sensitive nLC-MS/MS, a total of 12 out of 14 Gln residues in OPN were shown to be acceptor sites for TG2-mediated incorporation of the probe. Using the same approach, 23 out of 90 Gln residues in human complement C3 have previously been identified as targets for TG2 <xref rid="pone.0113650-Nikolajsen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This shows that though nLC-MS/MS is an extremely sensitive technique, not all Gln residues in substrate proteins are identified as targets for TG2 as is the case for OPN in the present study. So far, no consensus sequence for TG2 reactive Gln residues has been established, although there are reports showing that a proline residue in the vicinity of the reactive Gln residue is important for the recognition, especially in the motif Gln-xxx-Pro <xref rid="pone.0113650-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Sugimura1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Most of the identified reactive Gln residues in OPN are located in the near vicinity of a proline residue. It has also been suggested that the overall structure of the TG2 substrate proteins, rather than the primary structure around the Gln residue is important for the reactivity <xref rid="pone.0113650-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In that regard, it has been considered that TG2 preferably uses Gln residues that are located in disordered regions of proteins <xref rid="pone.0113650-Csosz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Biophysical studies have consistently demonstrated that OPN is an intrinsically disordered protein without any ordered structure <xref rid="pone.0113650-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, thereby all its Gln residues are potential TG2 reactive sites.</p><p>Based on the number of times the individual reactive residues have been identified and experiments using short TG2 reaction times (<xref rid="pone-0113650-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and a less sensitive HPLC approach, we found the highest TG2 preference for Gln34, Gln42, Gln193 and Gln248. It is therefore plausible that these residues are the most relevant target sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a multiple protein sequence alignment of 25 mammalian OPN sequences in which Gln34, Gln42 and Gln248 were found to be highly conserved throughout the analyzed species (<xref rid="pone-0113650-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113650.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Several functional important motifs like phosphorylation sites, glycosylation sites, the RGD-sequence and the cryptic integrin binding motif SVVYGLR are highly conserved. The conservation of these Gln residues suggests that they may also be important for the function of OPN.</p><p>The reactivity of Gln residues was not affected by the phosphorylation or glycosylation status of OPN, as practically identical results were obtained in the nLC-MS/MS analysis of native phosphorylated and glycosylated human milk OPN, dephosphorylated human milk OPN and recombinant (non-modified) OPN. This is in agreement with the formation of both intra-molecular cross-linked monomers and polymers of both recombinant and milk OPN after TG2-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and with other studies that show TG2-reactivity of both phosphorylated OPN from milk and bone, as well as bacterial expressed OPN <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Higashikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Nishimichi2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Srensen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Incorporation of the glutamine-donor peptide biotinyl-TVQQEL-OH showed that the C-terminal part of OPN contains the majority of the TG2 reactive Lys residues in OPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). MALDI-MS of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides also indicated that the majority of reactive Lys residues were located in the C-terminal part, as Lys4, Lys154, Lys156, Lys157, Lys206, Lys225, Lys231, Lys252 and Lys283 were identified as TG2 reactive residues. Identification of reactive Lys residues is not as straightforward as the localization of reactive Gln residues. The biotinyl-TVQQEL-OH probe is a peptide which hampers ionization in MS and complicates MS/MS interpretations compared to incorporation of the simpler 5-(Biotinamido)pentylamine probe. Furthermore, biotinyl-TVQQEL-OH is attached to Lys residues that subsequently cannot be cleaved by trypsin which results in larger peptides for the MS analysis. As the C-terminal part contains more Lys residues and several Arg residues advantageous for trypsin cleavage compared to the N-terminal part, it is not surprising that the MS analysis of tryptic peptides resulted in localizing of more reactive Lys residues in the C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, the MS analysis of the chymotryptic peptides only resulted in identification of reactive Lys residues in the C-terminal part. In summary, these data show that the TG2 reactive Lys residues in OPN are predominately located in the C-terminal part of the protein, though it cannot be excluded from this study that the N-terminal part contains more reactive Lys residues than Lys4. TG2 is much less selective towards amine donor Lys residues than it is with regard to the Gln substrates, and no consensus sequence for TG2 reactive Lys residues has been deduced <xref rid="pone.0113650-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, when comparing 30 different amine donors in characterized TG2 substrate proteins, a preference for Ser, Gln and Lys as the amino acid directly preceding the reactive Lys residue has been suggested to enhance reactivity <xref rid="pone.0113650-Grootjans1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Lys154, Lys156 and Lys157 are located in such sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and these residues were also present in five out of twelve peptides containing the biotinyl-TVQQEL-OH probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113650-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Polymerization of OPN by TG2 is physiologically relevant as it alters the functionality of the protein and especially its integrin binding properties <xref rid="pone.0113650-Forsprecher1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113650-Nishimichi2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, OPN seems to form homo-polymer protein aggregates rather than polymerizing in a heterotypic manner with other proteins <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kaartinen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. By site-directed mutagenesis it has been shown that especially Gln34 and/or Gln36 and to a lesser extent Gln42 and Gln55 play important roles in TG2-mediated homo-polymerization of OPN <xref rid="pone.0113650-Nishimichi2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These Gln residues in the N-terminal part are among the best conserved residues in OPN, as all 25 aligned sequences contained Gln36, Gln42 and Gln55 whereas Gln34 is only missing in the African elephant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113650.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In the present study, Gln34 and Gln42 are among the most TG2 reactive residues in OPN which also suggests an important role of these residues for the TG2 regulated function of OPN. Our data suggests that Lys residues in the C-terminal part most likely are the amine donors in the polymerization, as the N-terminal fragment of OPN was unable to polymerize. This observation is interesting, as the N-terminal fragment of OPN contains the integrin recognition motifs and that specific cleavage by <italic>e.g</italic>. thrombin and plasmin modulates the function of OPN and can lead to enhanced cell adhesion, migration and resistance to apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0113650-Christensen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Kazanecki1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113650-Yamaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Cleaved OPN has been suggested to play a role in a variety of biological processes such as cancer development <xref rid="pone.0113650-Yamaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0113650-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, formation of renal calcium crystals <xref rid="pone.0113650-Hamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and stem cell retention in the bone marrow niche <xref rid="pone.0113650-Grassinger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, the altered ability of the N-terminal part of OPN to polymerize when compared to the full-length protein may be of importance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the present study we have identified the Gln residues in OPN that are substrates for TG2. The major reactive residues were shown to be Gln34, Gln42, Gln193 and Gln248. OPN also contained several TG2 reactive Lys residues that were predominately located in the C-terminal part of the protein. Polymerization of OPN seemed to involve isopeptide bonds between residues located in the N-terminal part (probably Gln residues) and the C-terminal part (probably Lys residues). This can have important biological consequences for the activity of the highly active N-terminal fragment as it is not able to polymerize <italic>in vivo.</italic>
