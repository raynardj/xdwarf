Causes of such disparities are incompletely understood. Comorbid chronic inflammation likely is a factor. Recently, mast cell (MC) activation (creating an inflammatory state) was found to be a significant factor in sickle pathobiology and pain in a murine SCA model. Also, a new realm of relatively noncytoproliferative MC disease termed MC activation syndrome (MCAS) has been identified recently. MCAS has not previously been described in SCA. Some SCA patients experience pain patterns and other morbidities more congruent with MCAS than traditional SCA pathobiology (eg, vasoocclusion). Presented here are 32 poor-phenotype SCA patients who met MCAS diagnostic criteria; all improved with MCAS-targeted therapy. As hydroxyurea benefits some MCAS patients (particularly SCA-like pain), its benefit in SCA may be partly attributable to treatment of unrecognized MCAS. Further study will better characterize MCAS in SCA and identify optimal therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Indexing Terms:</title><kwd>sickle cell anemia</kwd><kwd>mast cell activation syndrome</kwd><kwd>KIT mutations</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>hydroxyurea</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The contrast between the mutational homogeneity (in beta globin) and clinical heterogeneity in sickle cell anemia (SCA) has long been recognized.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Putative factors associated with higher rates of painful vasoocclusive crises include higher hemoglobin concentration, lower hemoglobin F (HbF) concentration, higher hemolysis rate, higher blood viscosity and neutrophil activation, among others.

PGD<sub>2</sub> and heparin levels were the most useful for defining the presence of MC activation; urinary NMH levels were the least helpful. Tryptase is expected to be normal to perhaps minimally elevated in MCAS, a point of distinction between MCAS and mastocytosis that highlights the relatively new understanding that tryptase levels correlate more with total body MC load than total body MC activation state.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Consistent with the known effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on serum levels of tryptase<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and CgA,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> mean tryptase and CgA levels were higher in SCA/MCAS patients with CKD than without CKD. However, although there was virtually no overlap in the ranges of CgA between SCA/MCAS cohorts with and without CKD, there was substantial overlap in the ranges of tryptase between these cohorts. Plasma heparin testing yields readings in terms of anti-Factor-Xa activity, and although such testing is more commonly pursued to determine the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin therapy, the same test as applied in individuals not on heparin therapy reveals endogenous levels of heparin, which seems to be a sensitive and specific indicator of MC activation because it is known to be produced in humans only by MCs<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and indeed was the first MC mediator to be discovered nearly 80 years ago.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Also, of note, all the SCA/MCAS patients evaluable for symptomatic improvement from MCAS-targeted therapy experienced at least partial improvement, and nearly 1 in 5 experienced complete improvement, perhaps providing a basis for encouragement for other poor-phenotype SCA patients (and their physicians). Oddly, although hospital and/or emergency department utilization declined dramatically for some (typically more compliant) patients following institution of effective MCAS therapy, mean annualized such usage across the evaluable cohort did not seem to decrease. However, loss of one third of the total cohort to follow-up may have skewed these results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The sources of heterogeneity of clinical phenotype among SCA patients who all share the same point mutation in beta globin have long been investigated and debated. As noted above, a number of potential contributing factors have been identified, and yet it has generally been appreciated that a significant portion of the cause of poor-phenotype SCD (especially variants expected to be less morbid than SCA) remains poorly accounted. Inflammation has been proposed as a significant contributor to the morbidity and heterogeneity of such patients, but a common recurring cause of such inflammation has not yet been identified.</p><p>Recently, Vincent et al<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> found that in a murine model of SCA, MC activation underlies sickle pathophysiology leading to inflammation, vascular dysfunction, pain, and requirement for high doses of morphine, raising the questions of whether a similar process is present in sickle cell patients and whether therapies targeted at MC mediator production or action might help ameliorate some of the morbidities of SCD. The present series provides preliminary data that MC activation indeed is present in some poor-phenotype SCD patients, including not only those with SCA but also those with other sickle cell variants, and that therapy in such patients targeted at their MC activation can change the acuity of at least some of their clinical manifestations that traditionally have been attributed exclusively to their SCD.</p><p>Of hematopoietic origin, MCs are found in all human tissues, especially at the environmental interfaces and perivascular/perineural sites.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> They serve largely as sentinels of environmental change and bodily insults and respond by releasing variable assortments and levels of molecular mediators that directly and indirectly influence behavior in other (local and distant) cells and tissues to respond to changes/insults so as to maintain, or restore, homeostasis. The transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor KIT is the dominant MC regulatory element, shown to be critical for key MC functions including survival, differentiation, chemotaxis, and activation.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Traditionally, MC disease has been thought to be principally a matter of neoplastic burdens of MCs (ie, mastocytosis), with symptoms resulting principally from an accompanying inappropriate release of mediators from these excessive MCs. Nearly a quarter century ago, though, the notion was first advanced that there might be forms of MC disease manifesting inappropriate mediator release with little to no accompanying MC cytoproliferation.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This theory appeared validated when the first recognized cases of what is now called MCAS were published in 2007.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> MCAS typically causes chronic multisystem polymorbidity of a generally inflammatory theme.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Different patterns of aberrant expression of the large MC mediator repertoire in different MCAS patients make for markedly heterogeneous&#x02014;and thus diagnostically challenging&#x02014;presentations (see <bold>Table</bold>, <bold>Supplemental Digital Content 3</bold>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MAJ/A61">http://links.lww.com/MAJ/A61</ext-link>). The cause of such heterogeneity of mediator expression in MCAS is not yet clear. Provocatively, though, Molderings et al<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> have repeatedly found a broad array of (presumably mostly constitutively activating) mutations scattered across all domains of KIT in small cohorts of MCAS patients, with most of their studied patients bearing multiple mutations in no yet-apparent recurring patterns. (Interestingly, too, the MC KIT<sup>D816V</sup> mutation&#x02014;seemingly a driver of MC cytoproliferation, high serum tryptase levels, and other distinguishing features of mastocytosis<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02014;seems rare in MCAS.) Although the findings by Molderings et al have not yet been independently confirmed, it is noteworthy that similar mutational complexity (in KIT and other cellular controllers) has been found, too, across the spectrum of chronic MPNs within which the MC disorders reside,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and in mastocytosis itself.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Given these new biological and clinical insights, proposals have emerged to consider all MC diseases, including mastocytosis and MCAS, under the umbrella term of MC activation disease (MCAD).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> It also has been proposed that the assorted systemic MCAD variants and clinical phenotypes represent not distinct disease entities but instead varying presentations of a common generic root process of MC dysfunction.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Despite its rarity, mastocytosis is fairly readily recognizable because of its distinctive clinicopathological presentation, whereas MCAS, although suspected to be far more prevalent in the whole<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> than mastocytosis, is more challenging to recognize in large part because of the heterogeneity of its variant presentations, some of which are already discretely recognized (eg, idiopathic anaphylaxis,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), but most not.</p><p>Such clinical heterogeneity of MCAD, including MCAS, and the similarity of the pain syndromes in SCA and MCAD may challenge health care providers to recognize MCAD in sickle cell patients from symptoms alone. As MC mediator testing is ordered only after clinical suspicion of MCAD is established, markers of MCAD in routinely obtained laboratory testing would be useful. It is interesting that in the present series, as has been reported for the MCAS patient population in general,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> not only was mild relative monocytosis frequently found (long described as a component of the inflammation seen in many sickle cell patients), but there also was frequent finding of mild relative eosinophilia and basophilia, abnormalities perhaps more suggestive of inflammation driven by MC activation than by neutrophil or monocyte/macrophage activation from vasoocclusion-driven inflammation. Modest elevations in the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also frequently seen in the present series.</p><p>The present case series suggests for the first time the presence of MCAS as a factor in the morbidity of poor-phenotype SCA. As hypothesized by Vincent et al<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and others,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> several patients in the present series seem to have been significantly helped by therapy targeted at MC mediator production or action. Although it is interesting that current high-end estimates of the portion of the general population harboring MCAS (14%&#x02013;17%)<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> roughly correspond to the portion of the SCA population suffering a poor phenotype of SCA, specific prospective studies will be needed to confirm the portion of the SCA population truly harboring MCAS.</p><p>Many MCAD patients suffer migratory soft tissue and/or bone pain, which frequently responds poorly to typical (narcotic and non-narcotic) analgesics and atypical analgesics such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants. HU has long been recognized to effectively modulate the illness of SCA,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> including reducing pain crises, but its known mechanisms of action have not yet satisfactorily accounted in full for its observed effects in SCA.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> HU also has been used for decades to help occasional mastocytosis patients, provocatively sometimes reducing symptoms without clearly reducing tumor burden, and recently its utility in MCAS was also reported.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Thus, it is possible that another mechanism by which HU helps in SCA is to ameliorate comorbid MCAS.</p><p>Noncompliance seems to have limited the benefit many of the patients in the present series might have achieved from MCAS-directed therapy. Noncompliance is common in chronic illness and seems to be caused by many factors including the degree of chronicity of the illness. That SCA patients often are chronically ill since infancy poses a significant challenge to educating those with comorbid MCAS of the value of compliance with MCAS-directed therapy. Earlier diagnosis and effective therapy of comorbid MCAS in SCA may be a route toward reducing health care resource utilization and noncompliance.</p><p>As noted above, MCAD's heterogeneity and other issues pose diagnostic challenges (discussed in detail in recent reviews<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and with no predictors of therapeutic response yet identified, this heterogeneity poses therapeutic challenges, too. Nevertheless, with a wide range of therapies (see <bold>Table</bold>, <bold>Supplemental Digital Content 4</bold>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MAJ/A61">http://links.lww.com/MAJ/A61</ext-link>) having shown benefit in assorted MCAD patients, it seems likely that a patient, persistent and methodical approach to a series of medication trials would yield benefit in some poor-phenotype SCA patients also found to harbor MCAS. If MCAS is confirmed to largely be a clonal illness, it may be possible before long&#x02014;much as is developing in many other disease areas&#x02014;to follow diagnosis of MCAS (whether in SCA or other settings) by determination, through whole exome or genome sequencing of isolated peripheral blood MCs, of the patient's particular MC mutational pattern(s), which then might yield therapeutic insights leading to more efficient determination of effective therapy than afforded by the present trial-and-error approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Poor-phenotype SCD patients should be evaluated for possible comorbid MCAS. If found, MCAS should be treated, although biologically informed approaches to such treatment are limited at present and thus the path to effective individualized therapy can be challenging. Further study is needed to better characterize the prevalence and nature of MCAS in SCD and to define efficient approaches to identifying effective therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="maj-348-460-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e420" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="maj-348-460-s002.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e421" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="maj-348-460-s003.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e422" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="maj-348-460-s004.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e423" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the Linda Summerall Mast Cell Research Fund and the Kathy Klein Mast Cell Research Fund at the University of Minnesota Foundation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The author has no financial or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplemental digital content is available for this article.
