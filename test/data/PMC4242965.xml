Kinesio Taping application in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty subjects were
randomly divided into an experimental group and control group. The experimental group was
applied taping before therapeutic exercise, and the control group received only
therapeutic exercise. Functional gait was measured using the straight line walking test,
and dynamic balance ability was measured using the Berg Balance Scale. Walking velocity
was measured with the 10&#x02005;m walking test. [Results] There were statistically significant
differences between the results of the straight line walking and 10&#x02005;m walking tests in the
pre-post analysis for the experimental group. There were a statistically significant
difference in the Berg Balance Scale and 10&#x02005;m walking test between the two groups.
[Conclusion] Application of taping to the paralyzed parts of a stroke patient has a
positive effect on improvement of typical asymmetric gait and walking speed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a central nervous system disease that causes partial loss and functional disorder
of the brain due to a disability of blood supply in blood vessels of the brain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most stoke patients typically experience
motor function disorder<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and show an
abnormality in standing and walking because of asymmetric alignment and posture, abnormal
balance ability, lack of weight movement ability to the paralyzed part, and difficulty in
specific functional movements<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recovery
of motor disorders related to walking represents the most common objective for
rehabilitation treatment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive information from mechanoreceptors in the skin, articular capsule, ligament,
a semilunar valve, and muscles provides dynamic stability for each joint during dynamic
motion of a joint through a muscular reflex from the spinal cord level and
arthrokinetics<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proprioceptive
sense offers information about muscle length, muscle tone, and joint position, which
participates in motor control. In addition, a decrease in proprioceptive sense causes a
decrease in balance ability related to handling of postural control, joint movement
position, and external sway<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients also show abnormal walking patterns as compensation due to muscular
weakness and loss of balance ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
They experience a decrease in balance and walking ability because of symmetrical weight
shifting incapability and display an asymmetrical step length as a result of the relatively
weakened acceleration force of paralyzed extremities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, paralyzed lower extremities result in an increase in
asymmetrical walking and limitation in the movements of the upper extremities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the gait of hemiplegic patients shows
decreases in partial muscle control and synkinetic patterns, efficient treatment plans and
exercise methods are needed to achieve a normal walking pattern<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The advantages of Kinesio Taping (KT) are that it has a relatively lower cost and patients
can easily apply it by themselves. Moreover, it can be combined with other treatments and
guarantees safety, since it is a noninvasive method without side effects<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kinesio tape, which is placed on the
skin, provides a greater cutaneous nociceptive signal and improves balance and gait ability
by not only stimulating proprioceptive sense but also identifying the right position of the
joint even in a comfortable posture with no weight loaded<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, KT is well-known to be effective for increasing
functional movements by improving muscle strength and endurance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Besides, taping helps to maintain the coordination of
agonist, synergist, and antagonistic muscles by controlling muscle tones, inducing body
balance and muscle control recovery<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, balance and muscle control recovery through KT can increase gait speed<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, previous studies have investigated the effects of KT in specific parts of the
upper or lower extremities and have only revealed enhanced gait speed and balance ability
without observing increases in asymmetric gait when the center of gravity of the human body
leans to the non-paralyzed side. Nam et al. reported that treatment for patients should be
focused on improvement of not only gait speed but also symmetric walking for ideal walking
patterns<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study tried to determine a clinical approach and new evaluation
method that are more effective in stroke rehabilitation by analyzing symmetrical gait motion
and walking and balance improvement through the straight line walking test (SWT) after
applying Kt to the main parts of the upper and lower extremities of the affected side in
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty post-stroke hemiparetic individuals hospitalized in C hospital were randomly
recruited. Individuals who were diagnosed with stroke without orthosis and deficit in the
visual field and vestibular organ participated in this study after they received a full
explanation regarding the study. Subjects were randomly divided into an experimental group
and a control group. The experimental group was applied KT before performing therapeutic
exercise, and the control group performed therapeutic exercise but did not receive KT.
Each intervention was conducted 3 times a week for 6 weeks, and measurements were
performed before and after the intervention.</p><p>Patients who presented difficulty in walking associated with stroke and participating in
this project due to cognitive deficit or had a total joint replacement, fracture, or non
specific skin disease were excluded from the study. All subjects provided written informed
consent prior to participation according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A physical therapist applied 5-cm wide elastic Kinesio Tape to subjects as described
below. It was applied to the major parts of the affected side, quadriceps femoris, and
tibialis anterior of the lower extremities, as well as to the biceps brachii and upward
rotators of the scapulas of the upper extremities. The flexible tape was attached to the
skin not elongated from the origin to the insertion of fully stretched muscles. The
subjects were informed that they could shower but that they should dry off completely and
that they should remove the tape immediately if they experienced any itchiness or skin
allergy. After application of the taping to the main parts of the upper and lower
extremities for 6 weeks, evaluation of the subjects&#x02019; gait and balance and comparison
between before and after the intervention were performed.</p><p>Functional gait was measured using the SWT. After blocking the subjects&#x02019; vision with a
blindfold, they were instructed to walk straight and stably to a target spot 10&#x02005;m away
from the start point in a straight line, and the angle between the start and end spots was
measured with a goniometer to analyze the gait difference as subjects veered in one
direction or another. Any possible noise was removed to avoid compensatory movement by
subjects depending on auditory information. Additionally, in the case of falling, an
experienced therapist was on stand by in the back silently not to lead directions
unconsciously for the patients who were walking with shut eyes.</p><p>Dynamic balance was measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS is clinically
used to evaluate balance ability in a standing position or movement of hemiplegia patients
with stroke or geriatric illness. This scale consists of 14 items, and each item is scored
from 0 to 4 points on a 56-point scale. It has been reported that patients with 46 points
or less need assistive devices when walking and have a higher risk of falling.</p><p>The 10&#x02005;m walking test (10MWT) was also measured with a tapeline, and duct tape was
attached to the start and end points of the 10&#x02005;m course to mark the path. An additional
distance of 4&#x02005;m was also marked with tape, providing 2&#x02005;m at the back and in the 2&#x02005;m at the
front of the lane to give the subjects sufficient room for acceleration and deceleration.
The subjects were asked to walk at a normal speed as usual. The walking time was measured
from the moment patient&#x02019;s foot passed the start line to the end line in 0.01-second
increments with a stopwatch. Each patient performed the test 3 times after an initial
practice run, and the average was calculated as the result. The 10MWT showed highly
reliable results the test-retest reliability was 0.95 and the interobserver reliability
was 0.90.</p><p>Regarding the statistical analysis for this study, the average values and standard
deviations were calculated using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0). The paired t-test was
performed to investigate the effects of the test before and after the intervention in each
group, and the independent t-test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2
groups. The significance level was &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were a statistically significant differences in the results of the SWT and 10MWT test

of the stroke patients to analyze the effects on gait and balance ability.</p><p>Brain damage causes hemiparalysis depending on the region in which the damage is located,
and 70 to 75% of patients have difficulty in full recovery and have accompanying problems
such as motor, gait, sense, and activities of daily living disturbances<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such disorders reduce mobility and activities of daily
living, and a lack of mobility in the lower extremities in particular has an adverse effect
on gait and balance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance and gait
disturbances especially result in an unstable standing posture and walking due to muscle
tone disorder and weight bearing on the non-affected side rather than visible or vestibular
abnormalities<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The representative asymmetric walking pattern of stroke patients is believed to be the
result of weakened strength due to deteriorated hip flexors in the paralyzed lower extremity
increasing the swing time during the swing period, causing excessive motion of non-paralyzed
parts of the body as a means of compensation to increase the gait speed, which may lead to a
more asymmetric gait pattern. Such improvement is believed to be just speed increase without
any effect on walking cycle and symmetry<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most ideal walking pattern for stroke patients is to increase
the walking speed and improve the asymmetric walking pattern<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Page et al. reported that functional independence of stroke
patients can be improved through the treatment for symmetry<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. From this, it can be inferred that improvement of balance and
walking ability can be induced by direct stimulation of muscles of the paralyzed parts of
extremities<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The initial mechanism with regard to the enhancement of muscle strength and muscle control
is that cutaneous fusimotor reflex increases fiber tension, resulting in excitation of
primary and secondary nerve endings, thus, helping afferent sensory nerve activity<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanism of taping is improvement of muscle strength by
excitation of gamma motor nerves in skeletal muscle, as the taped part raises the tension of
the fiber<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, spatial summation makes neurotransmitter isolated and
postsynaptic potential is generated without action potential of pre-synaptic nerve. In other
words, an additive effect occurs by stimulating many nerve fascicles that compose synapses
simultaneously through taping. Finally, an irradiation phenomenon occurs in the area of
increased reaction strength.</p><p>This study showed significant differences in the results of the SWT and 10MWT applying KT
directly to paralyzed parts of the body (p&#x0003c;0.05). Based on these results, it can be
inferred that applying KT facilitated muscle activation in non-paralyzed parts of the body,
induced gait symmetry, and decreased weight bearing on the non-affected side. In addition,
there was a significant decrease in the results of the 10MWT in which walking speed was
measured after KT (p&#x0003c;0.05). This suggests that applying KT leads to improvement not only
in gait symmetry but also in walking speed through muscle facilitation in the paralyzed
parts of the body<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is because KT
effectively stimulated the proprioceptive sense, muscle spindles, Golgi tendons, etc., and
strengthened muscles in the affected parts. Furthermore, the results for the BBS generally
seemed to be improved, but there was no significant statistical difference in the
experimental group. There were no significant differences in the results of the SWT, BBS,
and 10MWT in the control group.</p><p>This study found a significant differences in comparison of the effects of treatment
between the 2 groups on the results of the SWT and 10MWT (p&#x0003c;0.05). The experimental group
showed significant improvement in the SWT and 10MWT compared with the control group.</p><p>This research was conducted to investigate the effects of KT applied to the upper and lower
extremities on asymmetric gait, walking speed, and balance ability in stroke patients. The
experimental group, which received KT, showed significant improvement in the SWT and 10MWT.
Additionally, the experimental group showed significant improvement in comparison with the
control group in the SWT and 10MWT. Thus, it can be interpreted that applying KT to the
paralyzed parts of a stroke patient has a positive effect on improvement of typical
asymmetric gait and walking speed.</p><p>However, this research had small number of subjects and needs more validity as an
evaluation index of asymmetric gait in stroke patients, and it was not possible to control
every effectible situation excepting treatment arbitration. Moreover, there was also a
geographical limitation, as a limited number of patients were recruited from one local
hospital, so it may be difficult to generalize the results to stroke patients in
general.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Prange</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Jannink</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Groothuis-Oudshoorn</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Systematic review of the effect of robot-aided therapy on
