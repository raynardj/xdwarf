intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolic syndrome markers, and
high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin among obese middle-aged women. [Subjects] The
subjects were 14 obese middle-aged women. [Methods] The exercise program involved walking
at 50&#x02013;60% of the maximum oxygen consumption, 3 times a week, for 24 weeks. Body
composition analysis, blood pressure measurements, and blood analysis were performed
before the exercise program and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. [Results] The results showed
that after 24 weeks in the exercise program, the obesity indices and metabolic risk
factors, namely, weight, body fat, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and triglycerides decreased significantly, whereas
HDLC, a metabolic improvement factor, increased significantly. Additionally,
VO<sub>2max</sub> increased significantly, together with the level of total and HMW
adiponectins. Correlation analysis of the changes in measured variables (&#x02206; score) during
resulting from the 24-week exercise program showed that body fat had a significant
negative correlation and VO<sub>2max</sub> had a significant positive correlation with HMW
adiponectin. [Conclusion] Among obese middle-aged women, regular exercise increases
cardiorespiratory fitness and HMW adiponectin expression and therefore can be effective in
the prevention and treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Cardiorespiratory fitness</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity has prompted most countries to focus on
its prevention and treatment to improve public health. Obesity is defined as an excessive
accumulation of adipose tissue that leads to health problems and, in pathological terms,
serves as the main risk factor for metabolic syndrome<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of disorders consisting of
obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, which may increase the risk
for the development of chronic disease<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Adipose tissues have been traditionally considered as the energy reservoir of the body.
Recently, they have been recognized as an endocrine organ with various biological
activities, including the synthesis of adipocytokines. Adiponectin is an adipocytokine that
acts as an important mediator in insulin and glucose metabolism. The mechanism of
adiponectin is currently a major focus in obesity and metabolic syndrome research. The name
adiponectin was derived from the fusion of the terms adipocyte and protein, thus signifying
a protein secreted by the adipose tissue. Its plasma concentration is within the range of
5&#x02013;30&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/ml, which is 1,000 times higher than the hormones leptin and cortisol and about 1
million times higher than the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and interleukin
(IL)-6<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically,
high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin is the biologically active form of adiponectin and
is more functionally important than low-molecular-weight (LMW) and medium-molecular-weight
(MMW) adiponectin<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The currently elucidated roles of adiponectin include promoting oxidation of fat in the
liver and muscles to improve insulin sensitivity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the secretion of cytokines
from endothelial cells, and anti-atherosclerotic effects by suppressing the proliferation
and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells promoted by the platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the concentration
of adiponectin plays an important role in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis and is
also closely associated with an increased risk for obesity and the components of metabolic
syndrome such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Finding ways to increase the secretion of adiponectin or its activity has been suggested to
be a potential factor in the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders, and one of the
most effective ways to achieve this condition is through regular exercise. Regular exercise
decreases abdominal fat, increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), decreases
neutral fat, decreases blood pressure, and increases insulin sensitivity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, the increase in metabolic
equivalents and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) due to exercise has been reported to
decrease the risk for metabolic syndrome, increase insulin sensitivity, and prevent
cardiovascular diseases<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In studies on the relationship between exercise and
adiponectin, Esposito et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> applied
dietary changes and aerobic exercise to obese middle-aged women and observed a decrease in
body weight and a significant increase in adiponectin levels. Kriketos et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an increase in adiponectin levels
when overweight men engaged in walking exercises for 40&#x02005;min a day, 4&#x02013;5 times a week, for 10
weeks, at an intensity of 55&#x02013;70% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>).
Furthermore, Boudou et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that
middle-aged men and women who underwent a 16-week exercise program consisting of 30&#x02005;min of
aerobic exercise 5 times a week, at an intensity of 80&#x02013;90% HRmax exhibited an increase in
adiponectin levels. However, Polak et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported no changes in adiponectin among obese women who
participated in a 12-week program consisting of aerobic exercise 5 times a week at an
intensity of 50% VO<sub>2max</sub>. Giannopoulou et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> also did not observe any changes in adiponectin expression after 6
months of aerobic exercise, although a decrease in blood insulin concentrations and an
increase in insulin sensitivity were reported. In a 6-month study on weight loss through
dietary changes or treatment with medications that decrease insulin sensitivity, the total
adiponectin levels did not change, although HMW adiponectin increased<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various studies have reported the effect of exercise on adiponectin expression; however,
they have reported show conflicting findings. Furthermore, studies on the effect of
long-term exercise intervention on adiponectin in middle-aged women, who generally undergo
changes in body weight, are currently insufficient to generate robust conclusions.
Additionally, we believe that assessing HMW adiponectin along with total adiponectin can
more effectively determine the effect of exercise on this specific population. Therefore,
the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 24-week exercise intervention on
the cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolic syndrome indices, and HMW adiponectin in
middle-aged women.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>SUBJECT AND METHODS</title><p>The study population included 14 middle-aged women who were 42 to 55&#x02005;years of age and free
of medical disorders. The subjects were selected after assessing age, physical activity
level, changes in body weight in the past year, smoking, and current medication. Women who
had both a waist circumference (WC) &#x02265; 80&#x02005;cm and a body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;
25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and exercised less than twice a week were selected as subjects. Before

Bruce protocol as described in the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
guidelines<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, the speed
of the treadmill was initially set at a comfortable walking speed of 1.0&#x02013;1.7 mph and at 10%
grade. Speed and grade were then increased every 3&#x02005;min until volitional exhaustion.
VO<sub>2</sub> was measured using standard breath-by-breath techniques of pulmonary gas
exchange variables (Metabolic Gas Analyzer System; Quark b<sup>2</sup>, Cosmed Rome, Italy)
and exercise heart rate was measured using 12-lead electrocardiography (Q4500, Quinton
Instrument Company, Bothell, WA, USA). VO<sub>2max</sub> was considered as the highest
oxygen consumption attained at the moment of exhaustion<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the incremental exercise test, the rate of perceived
exertion (RPE, Borg scale) was measured. RPE was reported by the subjects at the end of each
session based on the response to the question, &#x0201c;How hard did you work during this session?&#x0201d;
The subjects rated their RPE while looking at a printed copy of the Borg scale. This
self-reported scale has a score ranging from 6 to 20 and uses descriptive cues for each
category of exertion within the scale, ranging from &#x0201c;very, very light&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very, very
heavy&#x0201d;<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The requirements to strictly
define whether subjects reached their VO<sub>2max</sub> max included meeting at least two of
the following four criteria: (1) a respiratory exchange ratio of &#x0003e;1.15; (2) rate of
perceived exertion &#x0003e;17 for the original category scale; (3) volitional exertion; and (4)
achievement of age-predicted maximal heart rate. Study participants were verbally encouraged
to exercise to exhaustion during the test.</p><p>The exercise program in this experiment consisted of walking at an intensity of 50&#x02013;60%
VO<sub>2max</sub>, 3 times a week, for 24 weeks. After a treadmill VO<sub>2max</sub> test,
the individual&#x02019;s regression line was calculated from the oxygen consumption per minute and
heart rate. To determine whether the target calorie expenditure was achieved, the target
heart rate of the subject during the walking exercise was assessed using an automatic heart
rate monitor (Polar S610i heart rate monitor, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland), from which
energy expenditure was calculated. The energy expenditure per session was set at 400&#x02005;kcal,
120&#x02005;kcal per week (three sessions per week), and the duration of each session was set
between 60 and 120&#x02005;min, depending on individual performance.</p><p>Height and body mass were recorded using a stadiometer attached to a scale (DS-102, Jenix,
Seoul, Republic of Korea). WC measurements were made using a cloth tape measure at the level
of the umbilicus. Percent body fat was assessed using an X-scan II bioelectrical body
composition analyzer (Jawon Medical, Seoul, Republic of Korea), according to the procedures
recommended by the ACSM<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. After a
resting period of at least 5&#x02005;min in a sitting position, resting BP was measured using an
automated blood pressure cuff (FT-500R Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor, Jawon Medical,
Seoul, Republic of Korea). All procedures were administrated by trained technicians who
followed standardized protocols.</p><p>To minimize any possible effects of the last meal consumed before blood collection, the
samples were collected after a 10&#x02013;12&#x02005;h overnight fast and in a sitting position. Blood
samples were collected before the exercise program and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 of the
exercise program at the same time of the day and under the same conditions. The plasma was
separated from the whole blood by centrifugation at 4&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and plasma triglyceride levels were
determined using a TG slide (Vitros TRIG DTD, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA)
and Vitros Chemistry DT60II (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). HDLC was
determined after precipitating apoB-containing cholesterol with magnesium chloride and
dextran sulfate using an HDLC slide (HDL cholesterol; Vitros HDLC DTD, Johnson &#x00026;
Johnson, NY, USA) and Vitros Chemistry DT60II (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ,
USA). Glucose levels were determined using a glucose slide (Vitros GLU DTD, Johnson &#x00026;
Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and Vitros Chemistry DT60II (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, New
Brunswick, NJ, USA).</p><p>Total adiponectin levels were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (BioVendor LLC,
Asheville, NC, USA) and HMW adiponectin levels were measured using an ELISA kit (Daiichi
Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>We used the Shapiro-Wilk test for detecting the normality of the observed data. The
significance level of the variables was above 0.05, indicating a normal distribution. All
data are presented as the mean with standard deviation and the changes in the average of the
measured variable before and after the 24-week exercise program were analyzed using the
paired sample t test. In addition, the score changes (&#x02206;) before and after the 24-week
exercise program were calculated and the correlation between the measured variables was
tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient. All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSS for Windows (version 14.0) software, with p = 0.05 as the threshold of
statistical significance.(&#x02206; score = score changes between before and after the 24-week

aerobic exercise to reduce obesity and increase CRF and have suggested 50&#x02013;85% of
VO<sub>2max</sub> as an appropriate intensity. This study showed that a 24-week walking
program at 50&#x02013;60% of VO<sub>2max</sub> improved the CRF of obese women. This is consistent
with prior studies reporting CRF improvements as result of regular walking exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
and we think the exercise was suitable for the purpose of this study.</p><p>The results of our study showed that a 24-week regular exercise program significantly
improved obesity indices and metabolic risk factors of weight, percent body fat (%BF), BMI,
WC, SBP, DBP, and TG. This is consistent with results of previous studies showing that
regular exercise decreases obesity and metabolic risk fators; for example, it was shown to
decrease abdominal obesity, improve blood pressure, decrease the neutral fat percentage, and
increase HDLC<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Venables and Jeukendrup<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that exercise is effective in improving obesity because
it leads to a decrease in body fat, an increase in fat-free mass, and an overall activation
of body function, compared with other measures. Additionally, a decrease in waist
circumference from exercise indicates a decrease in abdominal fat and this is effective in
decreasing the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wessel et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>
surveyed 906 women in terms of obesity, CRF, and death rate due to atherosclerosis and
reported that low CRF is directly correlated with death rate. These results suggest that
maintenance and improvements of CRF through regular exercise, along with obesity prevention,
are important approaches in preventing and treating cardiovascular and metabolic
diseases.</p><p>In this study, total and HMW adiponectin significantly increased after the 24-week exercise
program, compared with the values before the program. Further, the correlation of the score
changes of the measured variables before and after the program (&#x02206; score) showed that body
fat, which decreased as a result of exercise, is inversely correlated with HMW adiponectin,
which increases as body fat decreases.</p><p>In previous studies on adiponectin expression in response to exercise, Gan et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the blood adiponectin
concentration increased by up to 260% in 19 obese men who exercised for 10 weeks, 4&#x02013;5 times
a week, at 55&#x02013;70% of the VO<sub>2max</sub> intensity, compared with the non-exercise group,
despite the lack of a change in body weight. Hulver et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 11 healthy men and women and reported that after 6 months
of an endurance exercise program, 4 times a week at 65&#x02013;80% of the VO<sub>2max</sub>
intensity, the group that showed a decrease in body weight also showed a significant
increase in adiponectin levels. However, the group that did not show a decrease in body
weight showed no change in adiponectin levels. Yuji et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 27 middle-aged women with an average age of 55 and reported
that body fat and BMI decreased, whereas adiponectin levels significantly increased (by 20%)
after a 12-week program consisting of walking exercise 5 times a week at 65&#x02013;80% of the
VO<sub>2max</sub> intensity, which is similar to the results of our study.</p><p>The results of our study showed that the increase in VO<sub>2max</sub> due to the exercise
was positively correlated with HMW adiponectin, indicating that increases in the CRF from
exercise can be an effective method of increasing MHW adiponectin. Church et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> divided their subjects into 4 groups
according to obesity and CRF levels and compared their risks of early death. Compared with
the group with the highest fitness levels, the groups with the second, third, and fourth
highest fitness levels had 1.6, 2.8, and 4.5 times higher risks, respectively, of early
death. If corrected for CRF, obesity did not significantly increase the risk of early death.
Also, Church et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted an
additional 15&#x02005;year longitudinal study and reported that a decrease in CRF led to a
significant increase in risk of death. If CRF decreased by 1 MET, then the risk of death
increased by 20%. These results indicate that obese people with high CRF can have a
relatively lower risk of metabolic disorders than obese people with low CRF. In this
context, the decrease in body fat and improvements in VO<sub>2max</sub> from the exercise
intervention program in this study can be a very important factor in increasing HMW
adiponectin<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, adiponectin is considered an important factor in obesity and metabolic syndrome
and because people with abdominal obesity have an even lower concentration of adiponectin,
their risk of degenerative diseases such as diabetes, chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis,
and cancer is reported to be higher<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Specifically, studies show that the HMW adiponectin distribution is more important than that
of total adiponectin, highlighting the importance of the fraction of HMW adiponectin<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of our study proved that
regular exercise, by increasing CRF and decreasing body fat, could be an effective technique
for increasing total and HMW adiponectin. In addition, obesity indices and metabolic risk
factors are interrelated in a very complex manner and exercise can lead to a general
improvement in metabolism, without side effects that certain medications can have. These
results support the role of exercise in the treatment of obesity and chronic illnesses among
women in middle age, which is when changes in body fat distribution and incidence rates of
metabolic diseases precipitously increase.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization:
