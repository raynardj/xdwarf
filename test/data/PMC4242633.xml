However, chemical modification of an implant surface using currently available methods often results in the disruption of topographical features and the loss of beneficial effects during the shelf life of the implant. Therefore, the aim of this study was to apply the recently highlighted portable non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet (NTAPPJ), elicited from one of two different gas sources (nitrogen and air), to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces to further improve their osteogenic properties while preserving the topographical morphology. The surface treatment was performed before implantation to avoid age-related decay. The surface chemistry and morphology of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces before and after the NTAPPJ treatment were determined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope, a surface profiler, a contact angle goniometer, and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope. The MC3T3-E1 cell viability, attachment and morphology were confirmed using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 staining, and analysis of gene expression using rat mesenchymal stem cells was performed using a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that both portable nitrogen- and air-based NTAPPJ could be used on TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces easily and without topographical disruption. NTAPPJ resulted in a significant increase in the hydrophilicity of the surfaces as well as changes in the surface chemistry, which consequently increased the cell viability, attachment and differentiation compared with the control samples. The nitrogen-based NTAPPJ treatment group exhibited a higher osteogenic gene expression level than the air-based NTAPPJ treatment group due to the lower atomic percentage of carbon on the surface that resulted from treatment. It was concluded that NTAPPJ treatment of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces results in an increase in cellular activity. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this treatment leads to improved osseointegration <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (2012R1A1A2008659, NRF-2014H1A2A1020740 and NRF-2010-0027953).

Recently, surfaces composed of nanostructures such as titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanotubes have been studied because the topographical modifications using these structures were reported to be superior in promoting early biological events related to the adsorption of proteins, blood clot formation and cell behavior <xref rid="pone.0113477-Lavenus1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which all resulted in a higher degree of osseointegration <xref rid="pone.0113477-Ellingsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>However, certain cell bioactivity is more affected by the surface chemistry than by the surface topography <xref rid="pone.0113477-Anselme1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, as observed in recently developed, highly hydrophilic implant surfaces with better osseointegration than conventional surfaces <xref rid="pone.0113477-Sawase1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The effects of plasma on Ti surfaces have been widely studied, in particular regarding the modification of surface roughness, wettability and cell-surface interactions that result from treatment <xref rid="pone.0113477-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Shibata1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Despite many attempts to modify the chemical features of Ti surfaces, the time-dependent degradation of the chemical effects is substantial in that the strength of osseointegration is reduced in aged Ti surfaces compared with newly prepared Ti surfaces <xref rid="pone.0113477-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Additionally, chemical modifications made in a high-energy vacuum environment often result in the disruption of beneficial topographical features on biomaterials <xref rid="pone.0113477-Fridman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has been recently applied in many biological fields because it has the advantage of being sufficiently low in temperature that it can be used on biomaterial surfaces without resulting in topographical changes <xref rid="pone.0113477-Kalghatgi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure plasma device does not require a vacuum environment to operate <xref rid="pone.0113477-Duske1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, making it portable and thus usable for the treatment of biomaterial surfaces immediately before their application. The plasma treatment of biomaterials is known to render surfaces hydrophilic and to modify the oxide layer that interacts with the proteins and cells of surrounding tissue, which leads to an increased adhesion of cells and tissue compared with samples not treated by plasma <xref rid="pone.0113477-Duske1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. One of the most popular non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma sources is based on the dielectric barrier discharge, which has previously been applied to biomaterials in many studies <xref rid="pone.0113477-Bardos1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, there has not yet been a study that has applied an NTAPPJ to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes.</p><p>Therefore, this study was performed with the purposes of applying a non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet (NTAPPJ) produced using one of two gas sources to the surfaces of nanotube-based dental implants directly before surgery and of determining whether this procedure improved their hydrophilicity and osteogenic properties.

The TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes were formed by electrochemical anodization using a direct current power supply (Genesys, 600-2.6 Densei-Lambda Tokyo, Japan), during which a constant voltage of 20 V was applied for 1 h with an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 wt% hydrofluoric acid (HF).

All the specimens were sterilized using ethylene oxide (EO) gas at a temperature of 55&#x000b0;C for 1 h before each experiment. EO gas sterilization was chosen for sterilization of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes in the cell experiments because previous experiments we have verified that it has no effect on cell health <xref rid="pone.0113477-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Uhm1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>NTAPPJ Treatment</title><p>An NTAPPJ device was manufactured from the Plasma Bioscience Research Center (PBRC, Kwangwoon University, Korea); details concerning the device design can be found in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0113477-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Briefly, the working gas (either compressed air or nitrogen) was used at a gas flow of 5 L/min, and the distance between the NTAPPJ tip and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surface was set to 3 mm. Quartz with a depth of 3.2 mm was used as the dielectric and stainless steel was used as the outer electrode, which enclosed porous alumina of 150 to 200 &#x000b5;m pore size and 35% porosity. The total output power of the plasma was set to 2.4 W for both the nitrogen and air NTAPPJs. The discharges were formed at a discharge voltage of 2.24 kV and a discharge current of 1.08 mA. The discharge duration was 0.18 ms and the discharge filamentation frequency was 12 kHz during a discharge voltage period of 16 ms, which corresponds to a discharge frequency of 60 Hz. The number of discharges within the 1-ms discharge voltage period was approximately 100.</p><p>Three different NTAPPJ treatment times (0, 2 and 10 min) were used for the experiments. The groups subjected to these treatment times were labeled as NP0, NP2 and NP10 for nitrogen gas and as AP0, AP2 and AP10 for compressed air. NP0 and AP0 were used as controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Surface Characterization</title><p>The morphologies of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces before and after the 10 min NTAPPJ treatment were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7100F, JEOL, Japan) and an optical 3D surface profiler (ContouGT, Bruker, USA). An optical profiler is device that measures the surface height optically and represents the height as a color on a scale ranging from red to blue, on either 2D or 3D images of the surface. The optical profilometer was thus easily used for evaluation of the surface roughness difference at a particular position before and after treatment. The surface roughness characteristics were analyzed using the vertical scanning interferometry mode (VSI) using a green luminous source. Quantification of the roughness parameters was performed using software at a magnification of 10&#x000d7; with a scanning area of 63 &#x000b5;m&#x000d7;47 &#x000b5;m.</p><p>The wettability of both the test and control samples was measured by dropping 4 &#x000b5;L of distilled water on the sample and then measuring the contact angle after 10 s using a video contact angle goniometer (Phoenix 300, SEO, Korea).</p><p>Finally, the chemical compositions of the test and control sample surfaces were determined using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, K-alpha, Thermo VG, UK). Photoelectrons were generated by a monochromatic Al K&#x003b1; line (1486.6 eV) X-ray source, and the beam was powered at 12 kV and 3 mA, at a beam diameter of 400 &#x000b5;m.

Calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 stains (LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit, Invitrogen Co., Eugene, Oregon, USA) were then applied on each sample, and the levels of staining were assessed using a confocal laser microscope (CLSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to evaluate cell attachment and cell viability. The numbers of cells attached to the test and control surfaces were also assessed by water soluble tetrazolium (WST, Dae-il Lab, Seoul, Korea) assay.

RT-PCR was used to analyze, in particular, the expression levels of alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN) and the house-keeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Following plasma treatment, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> rMSCs were placed on both the control and test samples and were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for either 7 or 14 days.

Data analysis was performed using an ABI Prism 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The conditions for PCR were as follows: a 95&#x000b0;C/10 minute activation step, followed by a denaturation step of 95&#x000b0;C/15 seconds and a primer extension of 60&#x000b0;C/minute for 40 cycles.

One aim of this study was to apply the recently highlighted portable NTAPPJ to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes to improve their hydrophilicity and osteogenic properties while preserving the morphology of the nanotubular structure. Another aim was to circumvent the aging-related decline of these properties by taking advantage of the portability of the treatment setup.</p><p>The results of the morphological and topographical analyses before and after NTAPPJ treatment revealed that NTAPPJ treatment has no effect on the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubular morphology or on the average roughness value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), which is consistent with the results of previous studies that applied NTAPPJ to the surfaces of other biomaterials <xref rid="pone.0113477-Kalghatgi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Choi2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the preservation of the morphology and topography, the hydrophilicity was significantly different between the untreated TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces and those treated with NTAPPJs.

This improvement in hydrophilicity is expected to contribute to the osteogenicity of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes <xref rid="pone.0113477-He1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Notably, the NP2 and NP10 groups resulted in contact angles of zero degrees, whereas the contact angles of the AP2 and AP10 groups were reduced compared to the control values by a smaller amount.</p><p>These changes were accompanied by changes in the chemical composition of the samples that underwent NTAPPJ treatment, as determined by XPS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), and these modifications affected both cell attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and cell gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The XPS results showed increased O-H on the surfaces of the NTAPPJ-treated TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes compared with the controls. Additionally, the C-H and C&#x02013;C peaks decreased after the nitrogen- and air-based NTAPPJ treatments, whereas the O1s and TiO<sub>2</sub> peaks increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The removal of carbohydrates in the link to the C-H peak is known to induce an increased surface energy of the biomaterial surface, resulting in an increased hydrophilic state <xref rid="pone.0113477-Choi2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Additionally, it is well known that carbon induces the worst effects on cell viability <xref rid="pone.0113477-Malkoc1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and the reduction in carbon percentage on the surface of biomaterials is known to result in increased cellular attachment and the promotion of osteoblastic differentiation during implantation <xref rid="pone.0113477-Aita1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study, the atomic percentage of each element analyzed from the XPS peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>) indicated that the carbon content in the experimental group was reduced after NTAPPJ treatment. This result indicates that the constituents of the plasma are energetic enough to break the C-C and C-H bonds at the surface layer to form radicals that yield various oxygen functionalities on the surface <italic>via</italic> subsequent oxidation chemistry. The resultant reduction in the carbon content of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surface resulted in higher levels of hydrophilicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113477-t001">Table 1</xref>), cell attachment and cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113477-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) on the NTAPPJ-treated specimens compared with the controls. The EO gas sterilization was used as the method of sterilization for all of samples in this study, as it is commonly used for medical and dental devices. However, previous studies have indicated that cell attachment levels are lower with EO gas-treated samples, although no correlation with numbers of sterilization cycles has been presented <xref rid="pone.0113477-Vezeau1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Thierry1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Hence, the results of reduced cell attachment for untreated TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube surfaces in our study may have been affected by EO gas sterilization. However, our previous studies with same method of sterilization, EO gas <xref rid="pone.0113477-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Uhm1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, showed that there was no indication of compromised cellular attachment on the sterilized samples. Therefore, the effects seen here likely are not due solely to the method of sterilization used.

This finding is correlated with the results of RT-PCR at 14 days of rMSC culture, which indicated that the nitrogen-based NTAPPJ treatment induced higher osteogenic gene expression than the air-based NTAPPJ treatment did <xref rid="pone.0113477-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113477-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>In general, it was demonstrated that both the nitrogen- and air-based NTAPPJ treatment resulted in an enhanced capacity for osseointegration for the TiO<sub>2</sub> substrate.
