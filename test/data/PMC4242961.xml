Multiple studies advocate the use of
ergonomic computer workstations that minimize tension in these muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, increasing numbers of workers have
reported tension and pain in the muscles around their eyes along with headaches resulting
from computer work<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few studies
have focused on methods to reduce pain and tension in the muscles around the eyes, perhaps
because evaluating eye fatigue is difficult. Electromyography (EMG) is the most commonly
used physiological measurement tool, and facial EMG is sensitive enough to distinguish
subtle changes in emotion<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies
measuring the activity of the orbicularis oculi muscles have been conducted on diverse
populations, and orbicularis oculi activity has become an important predictor of eye
fatigue<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although newer computers have large monitors on which multiple
tasks can be performed, an increasing number of users link two monitors to create a large
display. Despite this trend, no studies have examined the effect of dual monitor use on the
muscles surrounding the eyes. Therefore, this study compared the orbicularis oculi muscle
activity during computer work with single and dual monitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ten computer workers who were 22 to 27&#x02005;years of age (mean &#x000b1; SD, 25.4&#x000b1;2.0&#x02005;years) were
included in this study. The participants were 173.2 &#x000b1; 5.2&#x02005;cm tall and weighed 63.2 &#x000b1; 4.7&#x02005;kg.
Subjects with a history of injury or neurological deficit in their upper extremities or
trunk during the previous year were excluded from the study. Informed consent was obtained
from each subject prior to study participation. This study was approved by the Inje
University Faculty of Health Sciences Human Ethics Committee. The activity of the right
orbicularis oculi muscle was recorded with a MP150 system (Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara,
CA, USA) using an EL254S (4&#x02005;mm, Ag/Agcl) electrode. All EMG signals were sampled at 1,000&#x02005;Hz
and analyzed with the AcqKnowledge 3.9.1 software (Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA).
The amplitude was normalized to the maximum voluntary isometric contraction. The subjects
performed computer work under three conditions. Under condition 1, a single monitor was used
(L-company, 20 in), and subjects typed text that was displayed in a PDF file on the right
side of a divided display into a program on the left side of the divided display. Under
condition 2, two identical monitors were used in a dual display (L-company, 20-inch), and
subjects typed text from a PDF file displayed on the right monitor into a program on the
left monitor. Under condition 3, two different monitors were used to construct a dual
display (an L-company 20-inch monitor and an S-company 20-inch monitor), and the subjects
typed text from a PDF file on the right monitor into a program on the left monitor. For each
condition, the workstation included a keyboard and mouse on a table and a swivel chair with
five wheels. The resolution of all computer monitors was set to 1,068 &#x000d7; 1,050. To allow for
lumbar motion analysis, the armrest and backrest were removed from the chair. The
workstation table and chair could be adjusted for height and were initially set to ensure
that the elbows, hips, and knees were flexed at 90&#x000b0;. The keyboard and mouse were positioned
30&#x02005;cm from the trunk, the monitor was reclined by 20&#x000b0;, and the top of the display was set at
eye level. Each study subject spent 15 minutes typing 300&#x02013;400 words using Microsoft Word
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) at each of the three workstations. The Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Repeated-measures one-way ANOVA was used to compare results among groups. p-values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The muscle activity of the orbicularis oculi under condition 1 (9.8 &#x000b1; 4.0%) was
significantly decreased compared with that under condition 2 (12.6 &#x000b1; 5.7%) or 3 (15.6 &#x000b1;
6.3%) (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The muscle activity of the orbicularis oculi under condition 3 was
significantly increased compared with that under condition 2 (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the current study, EMG was used to measure orbicularis oculi activity in computer users
and evaluate tension in the muscles surrounding the eyes. Eye fatigue was greater when using
a dual monitor. Activity in the muscles around the eyes was increased due to the increased
movement of the head and eyes from one monitor to the other, which required constant
refocusing and increased pupil action due to the larger screen area<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Eye blink, a
component of the startle response, can be measured by recording the phasic EMG activity in
the orbicularis oculi. The blink reflex varies with emotional valence; a greater response is
induced by unpleasant stimuli, and the response is increased by stress<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, a consistent increase in the muscle activity of
the orbicularis oculi is closely related to and likely a cause of eye fatigue, headache, and
stress in those who use computers for long periods<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the present study found that the activity of the
orbicular oculi increased when a dual monitor setup that comprised monitors from different
manufacturers was used, compared with that when both monitors were from the same
manufacturer. Despite using the same resolution, brightness, and contrast settings on the
monitors from the different manufacturers, subtle differences in brightness and resolution
required the eyes to readjust their focus, which increased the activity of the muscles
surrounding the eyes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, dual monitors are not recommended, as they increase tension
in the muscles surrounding the eye. If a dual monitor setup is necessary, the use of two
identical models from the same manufacturer is recommended. Yoo et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that improved computer workstations could prevent
musculoskeletal disorders. A previous study also found that differences in computer
workstations were associated with differences in fatigue<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study found that the use of dual monitors increased
orbicularis oculi activity; therefore, to decrease eye fatigue in computer users, computer
workstations that use either a single monitor or identical monitors from the same
manufacturer in a dual setup, are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
