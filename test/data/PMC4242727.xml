Human adipose derived stem cells - differentiated to adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> - are frequently used as a model system for white adipocytes, as most of their pathways and functions resemble mature adipocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, these cells are not completely like <italic>in vivo</italic> mature adipocytes. Hosting the cells in a more physiologically relevant environment compared to conventional two-dimensional cell culturing on plastic surfaces, can produce spatial cues that drive the cells towards a more mature state. We investigated the adipogenesis of adipose derived stem cells on electro spun polycaprolactone matrices and compared functionality to conventional two-dimensional cultures as well as to human primary mature adipocytes. To assess the degree of adipogenesis we measured cellular glucose-uptake and lipolysis and used a range of different methods to evaluate lipid accumulation. We compared the averaged results from a whole population with the single cell characteristics &#x02013; studied by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy - to gain a comprehensive picture of the cell phenotypes. In adipose derived stem cells differentiated on a polycaprolactone-fiber matrix; an increased sensitivity in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was detected when cells were grown on either aligned or random matrices. Furthermore, comparing differentiation of adipose derived stem cells on aligned polycaprolactone-fiber matrixes, to those differentiated in two-dimensional cultures showed, an increase in the cellular lipid accumulation, and hormone sensitive lipase content. In conclusion, we propose an adipocyte cell model created by differentiation of adipose derived stem cells on aligned polycaprolactone-fiber matrices which demonstrates increased maturity, compared to 2D cultured cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AE, AP and DR are funded by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7(2007-2013) under REA grant agreement n&#x000b0; [607842].

An important advantage of differentiated adipose derived stem cells compared to mature adipocytes, is that, in contrast to mature adipocytes, they can be cryo-preserved and expanded. However, there are several important differences between differentiated adipose stem cells and freshly isolated human mature adipocytes - for example levels of maximal lipolysis <xref rid="pone.0113620-Langin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and secretion of TNF&#x003b1;, VEGEF and bFGF <xref rid="pone.0113620-Blaber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Additionally, the morphology of differentiated adipose derived stem cells, with multiple lipid droplets and a comparatively large cytosolic volume, is different to mature adipocytes that have a large central lipid droplet occupying the vast majority of the cell volume. These differences are indicative of the differentiated adipose derived stem cell being an immature model of the adipocyte.</p><p>The development of new protocols and culture conditions for the differentiation of adipose derived stem cells to a more mature state would be beneficial for fundamental studies of adipocyte functions and mechanisms, as well as for <italic>in vitro</italic> drug screening, targeting adipocytes. In the search for improved differentiation protocols for human adipose stem cells many different approaches have been tested and there are now several established methods such as <xref rid="pone.0113620-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113620-Bunnell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113620-Galateanu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>To further improve the differentiation of stem cells to adipocytes, efforts have been made to provide the cells with a more physiologically relevant environment by using surface-structure and 3D culture systems <xref rid="pone.0113620-Guilak1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the aim being to provide a more <italic>in vivo</italic>-like surrounding in comparison to hard plasticcell culturing plates.Several, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of a cells structural habitat as a driver for phenotypic differentiation <xref rid="pone.0113620-Halbleib1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113620-vonHeimburg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Various surface-structure and 3D culture systems have been investigated for growing and differentiating preadipocytes/human adipose derived stem cells <xref rid="pone.0113620-Tanzi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These cells have been shown to differentiate to adipocytes in hydro-gels <xref rid="pone.0113620-Galateanu2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113620-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, as floating spheroids <xref rid="pone.0113620-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, on silk scaffolds <xref rid="pone.0113620-Mauney1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, in hollow bioreactors <xref rid="pone.0113620-Gerlach1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and on electrospun, synthetic fiber matrices <xref rid="pone.0113620-Gugerell1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Such culturing systems have been shown to increased lipid accumulation of adipose derived stem cells. This phenomena can also be observed in other stem cell lineages; for example human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells show increased adipogenesis following culture in 3D systems <xref rid="pone.0113620-Miyagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>For this investigation, a culture system composed of electrospun fibers was selected. An electrospun fiber system is advantagous because it is similar in structure to collagen type I bundles which form the majority of the extra cellular matrix framework in adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0113620-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and decellurized human adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0113620-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These types of matrices are porous, which ensures good availability of nutrients and oxygen for cultured cells. Additionally, cells embedded into fibrous structures are also relatively easy to image with optical techniques in comparison to most other 3D-culturing systems. High throughput imaging platforms are common in early drug discovery and therefore it is an advantage if model systems are compatible with such platforms, ie. imaging in microplate format. Furthermore, a commercially available matrix with low batch-to-batch variation is extremely favorable for drug discovery screening.</p><p>An attractive material for 3D-culturing is the polymer polycaprolacetone (PCL), the properties of which already meet various medical and physical specifications for safety in clinical applications, and it is biodegradable <xref rid="pone.0113620-Correlo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. PCL has an exceptional ability to form compatible blends, has low toxicity and good biocompatibility <xref rid="pone.0113620-Correlo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, PCL is already a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved material for use in the human body as both a drug delivery device and as a suture or adhesion preventing barrier <xref rid="pone.0113620-Darney1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113620-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Use of PCL containing matrices has already been shown to successfully support the differentiation of human adipose derived stem cells <xref rid="pone.0113620-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> into adipocytes and chondorocytes. In addition embryonic stem cells has been reported to differentiate into adipocytes in an electro-spun polymer scaffold <xref rid="pone.0113620-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, electro-spun PCL has not yet been tested for adipogenesis of human adipose derived stem cells.</p><p>PCL is suitable for electro-spun matrices and has already been demonstrated to be suitable for culturing of mesenchymal stem cells differentiated into bone <xref rid="pone.0113620-Yoshimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Functionalized PCL fibers with molecular groups that stimulate bone formation, have been reported to improve osteogenesis starting only from mesenchymal stem cells <xref rid="pone.0113620-Kolambkar1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113620-Pereira1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and from adipose stem cells <xref rid="pone.0113620-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113620-Yun1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, these reports encourage a first study of differentiation capacity and functionality of adipose derived stem cells when promoted towards a linage of adipocytes and cultured on electro-spun PCL matrices. This technique could lead to a viable method of achieving more adipocyte-like phenotypes in stem cell derived adipocyte models, than those currently in use.</p><p>To assess adipocyte phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic>, high resolution microscopy techniques are favorable, that can optically investigate the cells whilst they reside in or on a matrix. The optical investigation of cells in a complex matrix is one of the main assets of Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy, which offers intrinsic chemical selectivity by targeting molecular vibrations <xref rid="pone.0113620-Zumbusch1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The targeted vibrations are highly characteristic to certain molecules, as they vary with the chemical binding structures presented. This is useful for biological applications as C-H bonds, found in long alkyl chains of triglycerides and fatty acids, can be visualized.</p><p>CARS microscopy works by an application of two pulsed lasers onto the sample, overlapping in time and space to drive chosen vibrations. The difference between the two laser frequencies defines the desired oscillation to image the chosen chemical structure. The molecular response can then be read out by a third laser pulse, generating a blue-shifted signal, which is easily separated and usable for laser scanning imaging.</p><p>Since the signal is only targeted to a small area of the sample, where the two beams overlap, it is possible to perform 3D sectioning without the use of a pinhole, making this technique suitable for thick samples and cellular structures. The near-infrared light can penetrate further than conventional visible excitation beams used in fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, CARS occurs in the electronic ground state, minimizing potential photodamaging effects on the samples that can occur in more traditional imaging systems <xref rid="pone.0113620-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113620-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>As well as these advantages, the label-free imaging capabilities of CARS microscopy circumvents the difficulty that lipophilic dyes used to stain lipids for visualization also readily binds to the PCL fibers <xref rid="pone.0113620-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. CARS microscopy has been previously utilized as a non-invasive, label-free technique in lipid biology for the investigation of tumour cells, adipocytes, sebaceous glands and other lipid-rich structures <xref rid="pone.0113620-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of using aligned and randomly oriented PCL fibers matrices for large cell populations of stem cells differentiated to adipocytes by measuring proliferation, glucose uptake, gene expression and lipolysis. Furthermore, at single cell level, we investigate cell distribution in and on the scaffolds and intracellular lipid stores using CARS microscopy, making comparisons to conventional 2D cell culturing and freshly isolated mature adipocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Adipose derived stem cells were cultured and differentiated in tissue culture treated 96-well flat plastic plates (Costar 3595, Corning), PCL fiber plates NanoAligned, thickness &#x0223c;10 &#x000b5;M (9602, Nanofiber solutions, Columbus, OH, USA) or NanoECM, thickness &#x0223c;20 &#x000b5;M (9601, Nanofiber solutions, Columbus, OH, USA).

Pieces of subcutaneous adipose tissue from the abdomen were extracted under sterile conditions from patients undergoing skin reduction surgery and were then transported in a heated container to the cell isolation lab. The adipose tissue was physically disrupted, and then enzymatically digested with collagenase type II (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) in 50 ml falcon tubes (Corning New York, NY, USA) in a shaking 37&#x000b0;C incubator (65 rpm).

The custom-built setup is described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0113620-Enejder1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In brief; two picosecond-pulsed laser beams (532 nm and 1064 nm, 7 ps, 76 MHz) were generated by a diode-pumped solid state laser (Nd:Vanadate, 10 W). The 532 nm beam was directed onto an optical parametric oscillator (Levante Emerald OPO, APE Berlin, 690&#x02013;900 nm), generating a beam at a wavelength of 816.9 nm. The 816.9 and 1064 nm beams, driving the C-H stretching vibration at 2845 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, were overlapped in time and space and focussed onto the sample plane of an inverted optical microscope (Eclipse TE2000-E with a C2 Confocal Microscope scanning head, Nikon) using an oil immersion objective (Nikon Plan Fluor, 40&#x000d7;NA 1.30) with a total laser power of 50 mW (at the sample position). The emission of the CARS signal is limited to the high-intensity region of the focal volume, resulting in a spatial resolution of &#x0223c;300 nm. Single photon counting detectors from Becker&#x00026;Hickl GmbH were used to detect three different signals simultaneously. Beside the forward and back emitted CARS signals, intrinsic Multi-Photon Excitation Fluorescence (MPEF) signals were recorded between 495&#x02013;530 nm.

The significant variation between human donors is a strong argument for using multiple donors when studying gene-expression. The fact that we find differences on the functional level and protein levels between cells on the 2D plates and the fiber matrices are unlikely to be due to changes in the expression profiles, but rather to differences in post transcriptional regulation. This clearly argues for the importance of not relying solely on gene-expression analysis for determination of maturation of cells, since small, undetected effects on global transcription might give rise to larger effects on the functionality when numerous proteins in a signaling network are involved. Further exploration of the relationship between gene expression and function in adipocytes is important but beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Despite the absence of dramatic differences on individual gene level, hierarchical clustering can be used to analyze which of the culture systems are most closely related, based on the expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113620-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Undifferentiated cells showed a very different pattern to all the conditions tested. A comparison between differentiated cells; 2D, random and aligned fiber cultures, shows relatively similar patterns between all conditions.

We found decreased proliferation, increased lipid accumulation and a closer-to-mature adipocyte EC50 for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cells differentiated on aligned PCL fibers compared to 2D plates. Additionally, we found HSL levels and glucose uptake were higher in cells differentiated on random PCL fibers, compared to 2D. In summary these findings indicate enhanced maturation of adipose derived stem cells differentiated on PCL fibers, and we propose use of aligned PCL fiber plates for differentiation of adipose derived stem cells, when a model system is required for glucose uptake of human adipocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113620.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
