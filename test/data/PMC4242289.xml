glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which then positively or negatively regulates
transcription of many genes that govern multiple important physiological
pathways such as inflammation and metabolism of glucose, fat and bone. The
remodeling of chromatin and regulated assembly or disassembly of active
transcription complexes by GR and other DNA-binding transcription factors is
mediated and modulated by several hundred transcriptional coregulator proteins.
Previous studies focusing on single coregulators demonstrated that each
coregulator is required for regulation of only a subset of all the genes
regulated by a steroid hormone. We hypothesized that the gene-specific patterns
of coregulators may correspond to specific physiological pathways such that
different coregulators modulate the pathway-specificity of hormone action,
thereby providing a mechanism for fine tuning of the hormone response. We tested
this by direct comparison of multiple coregulators, using siRNA to deplete the
products of four steroid hormone receptor coregulator genes
(<italic>CCAR1</italic>, <italic>CCAR2</italic>, <italic>CALCOCO1</italic>
and <italic>ZNF282</italic>). Global analysis of glucocorticoid-regulated gene
expression after siRNA mediated depletion of coregulators confirmed that each
coregulator acted in a selective and gene-specific manner and demonstrated both
positive and negative effects on glucocorticoid-regulated expression of
different genes. We identified several classes of hormone-regulated genes based
on the effects of coregulator depletion. Each coregulator supported hormonal
regulation of some genes and opposed hormonal regulation of other genes
(coregulator-modulated genes), blocked hormonal regulation of a second class of
genes (coregulator-blocked genes), and had no effect on hormonal regulation of a
third gene class (coregulator-independent genes). In spite of previously
demonstrated physical and functional interactions among these four coregulators,
the majority of the several hundred modulated and blocked genes for each of the
four coregulators tested were unique to that coregulator. Finally, pathway
analysis on coregulator-modulated genes supported the hypothesis that individual
coregulators may regulate only a subset of the many physiological pathways
controlled by glucocorticoids. We conclude that gene-specific actions of
coregulators correspond to specific physiological pathways, suggesting that
coregulators provide a potential mechanism for physiological fine tuning in vivo
and may thus represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>coregulators</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><def-list list-type="simple" list-content="abbreviations"><def-item><term>CCAR</term><def><p>cell cycle and apoptosis regulator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CoCoA</term><def><p>coiled-coil coactivator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CoR</term><def><p>coregulator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dex</term><def><p>dexamethasone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMEM</term><def><p>Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERK</term><def><p>extracellular signal-regulated kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBS</term><def><p>fetal bovine serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GR</term><def><p>glucocorticoid receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H3K4me1</term><def><p>histone H3 monomethylated at Lys-4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H3K4me3</term><def><p>histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H3K9ac</term><def><p>histone H3 acetylated at Lys-9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H3K9me3</term><def><p>histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H3K27ac</term><def><p>histone H3 acetylated at Lys-27</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H3K27me3</term><def><p>histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-27</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPA</term><def><p>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JAK</term><def><p>Janus kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JNK</term><def><p>Jun kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP kinase</term><def><p>mitogen activated protein kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NF&#x003ba;B</term><def><p>nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NS</term><def><p>non-specific</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAT</term><def><p>signal transducer and activator of transcription</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNFR2</term><def><p>TNF receptor 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSS</term><def><p>transcription start site</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ZNF282</term><def><p>zinc finger protein 282</p></def></def-item></def-list></notes></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nuclear receptors are ligand-regulated transcription factors through which the cell
responds to external stimuli. They can detect the presence of a small molecule
ligand (e.g. a hormone, vitamin or metabolite) and modify cellular gene expression
to respond accordingly. The steroid hormone receptors &#x02212; including the
receptors for estrogens, progestins, androgens, glucocorticoids, and
mineralocorticoids &#x02212; form one class of nuclear receptors. Canonical steroid
receptor function involves the receptor binding to its ligand, which alters receptor
conformation and potentiates binding to a specific related set of DNA motifs that
serve as regulatory elements for specific genes. The DNA-bound receptors recruit a
large number of transcriptional coregulator proteins, which remodel chromatin and
regulate the assembly or disassembly of active transcription complexes on the
transcription start sites of the genes associated with the enhancer and silencer
elements. Coregulators are essential for proper gene regulation, and coregulator
mutants are involved in several diseases [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoid receptor (GR, official symbol NR3C1) is activated in humans by the
steroid hormone cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal cortex in response to
many types of stress and serves a homeostatic function by regulating many different
physiological pathways. Synthetic glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone (dex), are
one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs, used clinically for their
anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressive effects and in some cancer chemotherapy
regimens. They are highly effective but have a host of deleterious side effects such
as weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and
muscle wasting [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This reflects the role of glucocorticoids in regulating
inflammation and immune response, as well as metabolism of glucose, lipids, and
bone, among other physiological pathways.</p><p>A number of recent studies, each focusing on a single coregulator, indicated that
steroid receptor coregulators function in a gene-specific manner and are required
for regulation of only a subset of the genes activated or repressed by a steroid
hormone and its receptor [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
This invites the hypothesis that different coregulators could regulate different
physiological pathways controlled by glucocorticoids [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such a
hypothesis necessitates that different coregulators are required for hormonal
regulation of different sets of genes. However, direct comparisons of the
gene-specific actions of multiple coregulators for a specific steroid receptor in a
single cell line have yet to be reported. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an
unbiased, genome-wide analysis of the effects of depleting four different
coregulators on glucocorticoid-regulated gene expression in the A549 lung
adenocarcinoma cell line. We expected to find different but overlapping subsets of
genes that are controlled by each coregulator, and we used pathway analysis to test
whether these gene subsets represent different known physiological pathways that are
regulated by glucocorticoid hormone.</p><p>The four nuclear receptor coregulators used in this study were chosen based on known
physical and functional interactions and some structural homology. CCAR1 (cell cycle
and apoptosis regulator 1, also known as CARP1), is important for cell cycle
regulation and binds to nuclear receptors in a hormone dependent manner [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CCAR2 (also known as deleted in breast
cancer 1, DBC1, or KIAA1967) is a paralog of CCAR1 and has been shown to work
synergistically with CCAR1 in a hormone dependent manner to coactivate target gene
expression [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CoCoA (coiled-coil
coactivator, gene name CALCOCO1) has a coiled-coil domain, binds the p160
coactivator complex and enhances transcriptional activation of nuclear receptors
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lastly ZNF282 (homolog of Zfp282 in
mice and rats, also known as HUB1), has been shown to bind and coactivate estrogen
receptor and function synergistically with CoCoA [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Structurally, ZNF282 has five C2H2 zinc fingers that can bind DNA
along with a repressive KRAB domain [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
CCAR1, CCAR2, and ZNF282 can bind to the C-terminal activation domain of CoCoA.
Several combinations of these coregulators act cooperatively to enhance steroid
receptor activity in transient reporter gene assays [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We thus proposed to test whether the physical and
functional relationships among these four coregulators might result in substantial
overlap in the subsets of glucocorticoid-regulated genes and the corresponding
physiological pathways they control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and RNA interference</title><p>A549 human lung carcinoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#x000b0;C in
a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For coregulator depletion, siRNA was
transfected into A549 cells by using Oligofectamine according to the
manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Two days after transfection, the media was
changed to hormone-free medium (phenol-red free DMEM) supplemented with 5%
charcoal-stripped FBS. The next day, cells were subjected to hormone treatment
with 100 nM dex or ethanol as control for 6 hrs. For immunoblot assay, cells
were harvested right before hormone treatment in RIPA buffer supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). For RT-PCR assay, cells were
collected 6 hours after hormone treatment. The sequences of the sense siRNAs
used are as follows: nonspecific (NS) control siRNA [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; si-CCAR1, 5&#x02019;-GCCCTAGTATGGAAGATTT-3&#x02019;;

mixed with appropriate primers and LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche),
and the mixture was then analyzed with the LightCycler 480 System (Roche). The
primers used were as follows: &#x003b2;-actin [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; PPM1E,5&#x02019;-AGAGCCACATCAGATGAAGTCC-3&#x02019; (forward) and

6 hours after treatment of A549 cells with ethanol control or 100 nM dex, using
cells that were previously transfected with a control siNS (non-specific

experiments had 4 biological replicates performed on different days except our
siNS control (6 replicates) and siZNF282 (2 replicates). Analysis of the
microarray data was performed using bioconductor package beadarray (v2.8.1)
[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to process the raw data and filter non-specific probes followed

overlapped a set of hormone-regulated genes with no coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>, comparison 1), hormone-regulated
genes upon coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure

dex-treated cells with different mRNA levels when comparing cells containing and
lacking a coregulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>,
comparisons 3). From these comparisons, we identified dex-regulated genes that
are not significantly affected by coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> compartment i), genes affected by coregulator
depletion but not significantly hormone-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> ii), genes that remained hormone-regulated after
coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> v, vii),
hormone-regulated genes that were affected by coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> iii, vii) and genes that gained
hormone regulation upon coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> iv, vi). In our detailed analysis below, we do not focus
on genes that have similar gene expression levels after hormone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> iv) and that gain hormone
regulation upon coregulator depletion because this situation occurs with changes
of gene expression in the absence of hormone caused by coregulator depletion
(baseline differences).In general, we found fewer hormone-regulated genes after
coregulator depletion (comparison 2 smaller than comparison 1), and thousands of
genes were affected by the depletion (comparison 3), with ZNF282 depletion
having the largest effect with almost 3000 genes affected while the other
coregulator depletions have around 1100 genes affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c-f</xref>).</p><p>Except for ZNF282, the majority of hormone-regulated genes remained
hormone-regulated after coregulator depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> compartments v + vii are large compared to iv + vi or i +
iii). Of the genes regulated by dex either in the presence (comparison 1) or
absence (comparison 2) of coregulator, we found around 250 genes with their
dex-regulated level of expression altered by depletion of CCAR1 (245), CoCoA
(241), or CCAR2 (249), while 348 genes were affected by depletion of ZNF282
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> iii, vi, vii). These genes
correspond to about one fifth of all hormone-regulated genes (CCAR1: 254 / 1208
= 0.20, CoCoA: 241 / 1292 = 0.19, CCAR2: 249 / 1249 = 0.20, ZNF282: 348 / 1202 =
0.29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> iii + vii + vi / all but
ii). Additionally, with the exception of CoCoA, there were more
coregulator-regulated genes that lost hormonal regulation upon coregulator
depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> iii) than genes that
newly acquired hormonal regulation after depletion of coregulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> vi) (iii vs. vi: 100 vs. 29 for
CCAR1, 55 vs. 75 for CoCoA, 82 vs. 53 for CCAR2, 236 vs. 53 for ZNF282). Lastly,
of the 1033 hormone-regulated genes (comparison 1), 53% were affected by
depletion of one or more of the four coregulators studied (unique genes in the
sum of compartments iii + vii for all four coregulators).</p><p>The fact that ZNF282 depletion altered expression of a much larger number of
genes than depletion of the other three coregulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1f</xref> comparison 3) and reduced the number of
hormone-regulated genes more than did depletion of the other three coregulators
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1f</xref> comparison 2 vs. comparison
1) suggests that ZNF282 may have a greater impact on gene regulation than the
other three coregulators. Using no fold change cutoff (instead of the 1.5-fold
cutoff used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), we found similar
patterns of overlaps (Supplementary File 1). When a more stringent 2-fold change
cutoff was applied, most hormone-regulated genes were still shared in
comparisons 1 and 2 (compartments v + vii), but a lower percentage of
coregulator-regulated genes were hormone-regulated (Supplementary File 2,
compartments iii + vii). We concluded from this comparison that the pattern of
overlaps between the different coregulators remains consistent with different
fold change cutoffs, with higher fold-change cutoffs detecting fewer coregulator
effects.</p><p>Since this study analyzed the roles of coregulators in dex-regulated gene
expression, the subsequent sections focus on a subset of genes located in the
compartments where effects of coregulator depletion in comparison 3 overlap with
dex-regulated comparison 1 or 2 (compartments iii, vi, and vii). We defined as
"coregulator-modulated genes" those in compartments iii and vii, i.e.
genes that were regulated by hormone in the presence of coregulator (comparison
1) and regulated by coregulator in the presence of dex (comparison 3). Among
modulated genes, compartment iii contains genes that lose significant regulation
by dex after coregulator depletion, while compartment vii represents genes that
are significantly dex-regulated in the presence or absence of coregulator, but
whose mRNA level in the presence of dex was significantly altered by coregulator
depletion. We defined "blocked genes" as those in compartment vi, i.e.
genes that only become dex-regulated after coregulator depletion and whose mRNA
level in the presence of dex was significantly altered by coregulator depletion.
Blocked genes indicate a novel and perhaps unexpected type of coregulator
function where the coregulator was blocking the hormone response for genes in
this class. We found several hundred modulated genes for each coregulator
(CCAR1: 216, CoCoA: 166, CCAR2: 196, ZNF282: 295) and a smaller number of
blocked genes (CCAR1: 29, CoCoA: 75, CCAR2: 53, ZNF282: 53). Gene expression
changes and genes belonging to these two classes can be found in supplementary
Material</p></sec><sec><title>Modulated and blocked regulatory genes are often unique to each
coregulator</title><p>To evaluate coregulator specificity, we overlapped the genes found for each
coregulator in each of the two gene classes of interest to look for shared
regulation between different coregulators. Modulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>) have some overlap between the different
coregulators; however, about one third of the genes were unique to each depleted
coregulator (CCAR1: 38%, CoCoA: 31%, CCAR2: 32%, ZNF282: 39%) with about another
third shared with one other coregulator (CCAR1: 38%, CoCoA: 36%, CCAR2: 39%,
ZNF282: 38%) and the remaining genes shared by two or three coregulators.
Blocked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>) were nearly all
unique to each coregulator, indicating that this type of function was highly
specific for each coregulator. The largest overlap in blocked genes occurred
between CoCoA blocked genes and CCAR2 blocked genes with 8 genes shared (out of
53 genes for CCAR2 and 75 genes for CoCoA). Surprisingly, the high structural
homology between CCAR1 and CCAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1g</xref>) and the previously reported physical and functional interactions
among these four coregulators do not lead to substantial proportions of
modulated and blocked genes overlapping between the various pairs of

differences in the proportion of histone marks at TSS of blocked genes compared

Modulated genes were defined as dex-regulated in the presence of coregulator,
and their level of expression in the presence of dex was altered by coregulator
depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> compartment iii and

a coactivator or corepressor and can support or oppose the regulation by
hormone. However, the ratio of genes that were positively or negatively
regulated was unique to each coregulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure
5</xref>, ratio between numbers in table for each coregulator). We define
coactivated genes as being activated by hormone and requiring the presence of
the coregulator for activation, corepressed genes as being repressed by hormone
and requiring the presence of the coregulator for repression, anti-activated
genes as being activated by hormone but repressed by coregulator, anti-repressed
genes as being repressed by hormone but activated by coregulator. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref>, we show theoretical examples of
gene expression patterns for coactivated (upper-right) and corepressed

coactivated with CCAR1 supporting the direction of dex regulation. In contrast,
the predominant effects of CoCoA and ZNF282 depletion on dex-regulated gene
expression was negative, with ZNF282 having an anti-activating effect on many
genes. One reason ZNF282 could be having a greater repressive effect compared to
the other coregulators was because of its repressive KRAB domain [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The structurally-related proteins CCAR1
and CCAR2 share a similar direction of regulation for the modulated genes, with
the majority (80% for CCAR1, 62% for CCAR2) of genes regulated by the
coregulator in the same direction as dex. Over 60% of modulated genes were
up-regulated by dex (except for CoCoA which has 49%), and the anti-repressed

CCAR1, 8% for CoCoA, 11% for CCAR2, 8% for ZNF282).</p></sec><sec><title>Coregulator specificity in differential regulation of physiological
pathways</title><p>Glucocorticoids regulate many different developmental, metabolic, and
inflammatory pathways and mediate responses to various types of stress,
including hunger, cold, anxiety, and disease. The gene-specific actions of
coregulators, as documented above, provide opportunities for the cell to
modulate the specific genes that are regulated by glucocorticoids, through
regulation of coregulator protein levels or regulation of coregulator activity
via protein-protein interactions or post-translational modifications. To test
whether coregulator gene-specificity is associated with specific
glucocorticoid-regulated physiological pathways, we performed Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) on the coregulator-modulated gene set for each of the four
coregulators examined above. We focused on the anti-inflammatory actions of
glucocorticoids, since these complex pathways are key regulatory targets of GR.
In addition, glucocorticoid regulation of many anti-inflammatory genes is common
to a wide variety of cell types, including the A549 cell line used for this
study, whereas other glucocorticoid-responsive metabolic pathways may be more
tissue specific. IPA canonical pathway analysis found several inflammatory
pathways that were enriched among dex-regulated genes and in one or more of the
four coregulator-modulated gene sets under investigation in this study. Here we
focus our discussion on the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), acute
phase, and interferon signaling pathways, which provide examples of both shared
and coregulator-specific regulation of specific physiological pathways. The
TNFR2 pathway mediates signaling for TNF&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and includes the well
known NF&#x003ba;B inflammatory pathway as well as the JUN kinase (JNK) pathway,
which is one of the three mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways
[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In A549 cells dex
down-regulated several genes in both the NF&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways, as
expected since glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory (Supplementary File 10).
Depletion of ZNF282, CoCoA and CCAR2 increased expression of several
dex-regulated NF&#x003ba;B pathway genes, indicating that these three
coregulators support the down-regulation of this inflammatory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). ZNF282 was also required for the
down-regulation by dex of a key transcription factor, c-Jun, at the distal end
of the JNK pathway. In contrast, CCAR1 depletion had no effect on genes in the
NF&#x003ba;B pathway and had a mixed effect on the JNK pathway. A statistical
analysis by IPA of the predicted effect of each coregulator on the TNFR2 pathway
indicated highly significant effects by CoCoA and ZNF282 but non-significant
effects for CCAR1 and CCAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>

NF&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways controlled by TNFR2 but also includes the ERK and
p38 MAP kinase pathways and the STAT3 pathway. In addition to down-regulating
components of the NF&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways, dex also up-regulates STAT3 in
A549 cells (Supplementary File 11a). Depletion of ZNF282 and CCAR2 blocked dex
inhibition of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway, and depletion of ZNF282 and CoCoA
enhanced dex stimulation of STAT3 expression, whereas neither CCAR1 nor CCAR2
affected STAT3 expression in dex-treated A549 cells (Supplementary File 11b-e).
In contrast to the different pathway specificities of the four coregulators in
the TNFR2 and acute phase response pathways, all four coregulators had similar
effects on components of the interferon pathway in A549 cells. Dex
down-regulated the receptor for interferon &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and up-regulated
JAK1 and STAT1, key components of the interferon &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;
pathways (Supplementary File 12a). Depletion of each of the four coregulators
further enhanced the dex-regulated expression of JAK1 and STAT1 (Supplementary
File 12b-e). The only coregulator-specific effect was that depletion of CCAR2
(but none of the other three coregulators) prevented the down-regulation of the
interferon receptor by dex. A heat map of the top canonical pathways represented
in the dex-regulated gene set and in the coregulator-modulated gene sets can be
found in Supplementary File 13.</p><p>Lastly we analyzed the dex-regulated and coregulator-modulated genes using IPA to
identify candidate upstream regulators whose actions were predicted to be most
highly affected (Supplementary File 14). Although the details of the coregulator
effects on each upstream regulator are beyond the scope of our current
discussion, we note that the pattern for the effect of CCAR1 depletion was
almost completely opposite to the pattern of effects observed for the other
three coregulators, consistent with the predicted effects on the TNFR2 and acute
phase response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>;
Supplementary File 11). This unbiased analysis further supports the conclusion
that the gene-specific actions of coregulators may correlate with specific
physiological pathways. Similar upstream regulator analysis was not performed on
blocked genes due to the small number of affected genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Gene-specific actions of coregulators</title><p>Previous published studies from a number of laboratories that examined the
effects of individual coregulators on steroid hormone-regulated gene expression
indicated that coregulators act in a gene-specific manner and are required for
hormonal regulation of only a subset of all hormone-regulated genes [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These results also
suggested that different coregulators support the regulation of different sets
of hormone-regulated genes, but direct comparisons of multiple coregulators have
not been reported, to our knowledge. In the study reported here we conducted a
direct, unbiased and genome-wide comparison of the gene-specific roles of four
different coregulators on glucocorticoid-regulated gene expression.</p><p>Our results extend our knowledge of the gene-specific actions of coregulators in
a number of ways. 1) In a previous study [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with Hic-5 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells, we identified three
classes of dex-regulated genes, based upon the effect of Hic-5 depletion: dex
regulation modulated by Hic-5 (Hic5-modulated genes), dex regulation blocked by
the coregulator (blocked genes), and Hic-5-independent genes (independent).
Here, by examining four different coregulators we show that these classes
(including the novel blocked class) are common to coregulators in general,
indicating that multiple coregulators share this function. 2) As previously
reported each coregulator has both positive and negative effects on the
expression of different dex-regulated genes [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but we show here that the ratio of positive to
negative effects varies with the specific coregulator. 3) Likewise, each
coregulator can support the actions of the hormone on some genes and oppose dex
action on other genes, but the specific ratio of these effects is also
coregulator-specific. We thus quantify the extent to which each coregulator
functioned as a coactivator (supporting gene activation by dex/GR), a
corepressor (supporting gene repression by dex/GR), an anti-activator (opposing
gene activation by dex/GR) or an anti-repressor (opposing gene repression by
dex/GR). 4) We show that even when pairs of coregulators have extensive
structural homology or have demonstrated physical and functional interactions
(in transient reporter gene assays), they influence the dex-regulated expression
of quite different sets of genes. For each of the four coregulators examined,
one-third of the modulated genes they influence were unique to that coregulator,
and another third of the modulated gene set was shared with only one of the
other three coregulators. 5) In silico pathway analysis indicated that different
coregulators can have a dramatically different influence on different
physiological pathways regulated by glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>; Supplementary Files 10-14). Altogether, our
findings demonstrate by direct comparison that, although there was some overlap,
each coregulator influences the expression of a unique subset of dex-regulated
genes. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that the gene-specificity
of coregulators has important physiological implications.</p><p>The proportion of shared regulated genes among the four coregulators was quite
low with many genes being regulated in a coregulator-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The structural homology between
CCAR1 and CCAR2 does not increase the proportion of genes with shared
regulation, compared to other gene pairs. Of the 216 CCAR1-modulated genes, the
overlap with other sets of modulated genes were 59 for CCAR2, 55 for CoCoA, and
89 for ZNF282; of the 29 CCAR1-blocked genes, 2 were shared with CCAR2, 2 with
CoCoA, and none with ZNF282 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). A
small number of genes that required two structurally related coregulators has
also been shown before for CBP and p300 [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The mechanistic explanation for why different genes require different
coregulators for their dex-regulated expression presumably lies in the unique
regulatory context of each gene. When studying hormone-regulated gene
expression, regulation can occur at multiple levels. GR, as well as other
DNA-binding transcription factors, can bind to a related but extremely diverse
set of motifs located within enhancer and silencer elements, and each
transcription factor can regulate different sets of genes in different cell
types. GR can recruit different combinations of coregulator proteins to its
binding sites in the regulatory elements (enhancers and silencers), and each
element also has different requirements for the types of coregulators required
for dex-regulated expression of the associated gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Whether or not a coregulator was recruited by GR
to a regulatory element and required for dex-regulated expression of the
associated gene will depend on the regulatory context of each regulatory
element, because each regulatory element exists in a unique environment dictated
by several different factors: GR binding site sequence, which influences GR
conformation; binding of transcription factors to nearby or distant interacting
sites, which can contribute to the complement of coregulators recruited to the
site; and local chromatin structure, which can help to dictate the specific
coregulators required to establish an appropriate chromatin environment (open or
condensed) for the positive or negative regulatory actions directed by GR. Our
results reflect the diversity of regulatory environments and the resulting
diversity of coregulator requirements among the dex-regulated genes.</p><fig id="f7" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Regulation of gene expression occurs at multiple levels. </title><p>In our model system, nuclear receptors bind to enhancers after hormone
treatment and recruits coregulators. Different coregulators are
recruited to (and/or required for) each enhancer and each enhancer
regulates one or a few target genes. Coregulators can serve as an
intermediate regulatory step for hormone regulation through differential
recruitment to and requirement for enhancers as well as having both
coactivating and corepressive effects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nrs-12-002-g7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Validation of the coregulator-modulated, blocked, and independent classes of
dex-regulated genes</title><p>For all four coregulators, we identified genes that fall into the
coregulator-modulated, coregulator-blocked, and coregulator-independent classes
of dex-regulated genes, consistent with our previous observations of these three
classes for the action of the coregulator Hic-5 in dex-regulated gene expression
in U2OS cells [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The
coregulator-modulated genes for each of the four coregulators in this study
represented 16-29% of all genes that were regulated by dex without coregulator
depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a-b</xref>, compartments iii +
vii compared with comparison 1), and more than one-third of each
coregulator-modulated gene set were not shared with any of the other three
coregulators. This suggests that each coregulator influences a distinct portion
of the biological response to dex. The blocked gene sets were considerably
smaller than the modulated sets, but nevertheless we find that this class was
common to all of the coregulators tested, indicating that each coregulator
prevented dex-regulation of a specific set of genes. While the mechanisms
through which CCAR1, CCAR2, CoCoA, and ZNF282 block efficient dex regulation of
genes remain to be determined, we showed previously that blocking of dex
regulation of genes by Hic-5 involved interference with GR binding on DNA sites
and chromatin remodeling at those sites [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our meta-analysis of ENCODE data from A549 cells indicates that
there was an increased frequency of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the
TSS of coregulator-blocked genes compared with all dex-regulated genes, and a
decreased frequency of the active histone modification H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings provide clues for
potential regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>While the dex-regulated gene set contained genes with very robust and modest
fold-changes in response to dex, the blocked genes universally displayed modest
fold changes upon hormone treatment (Supplementary File 9). A limited degree of
regulation by dex could be an inherent property of the blocked gene set, or it
could be attributed in part to incomplete depletion of the coregulators
(Supplementary File 7). However, we note that depletion of each of the four
coregulators produced a robust biological effect in terms of the number of
coregulator-modulated genes.</p><p>Direct comparisons, such as the one performed here, are required to compare
properly the effects of depletion of different coregulators. Nevertheless, as a
generalization we note that the numbers of genes in the coregulator-modulated
class were similar among the four coregulators studied here and two previously
studied coregulators, Hic-5 [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and G9a
[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, many more blocked
genes were observed for Hic-5 than for the four coregulators studied here. Hic-5
depletion caused all-or-none effects on the hormonal regulation of many
dex-regulated genes, while the effects of depleting CCAR1, CCAR2, CoCoA, ZNF282,
and G9a generally resulted in less dramatic changes in the hormone response of
individual genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential modulation of glucocorticoid-regulated physiological pathways by
individual coregulators</title><p>Our pathway analyses of the modulated gene sets for four coregulators indicated
that ZNF282, CoCoA, and CCAR2 were all involved in supporting various aspects of
the anti-inflammatory actions of dex. Thus, although among these three
coregulators there is a relatively low percentage of overlap in the
dex-regulated genes they control, they cooperate in facilitating dex regulation
of a number of important inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and Supplementary Files 10-14).
However, depletion of CCAR1 had no effect on dex regulation of genes in TNFR2
and acute phase pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>;
Supplementary Files 10-11). In contrast, all four coregulators had similar
actions on the interferon signaling pathways (Supplementary File 12), consistent
with the notion of pathway-specific actions of GR coregulators.</p><p>Our results for CCAR1 in this study extend our previous analysis of the
pathway-specificity of this coregulator. We previously tested the effects of
depleting 10 different coregulators on the ability of dex to induce expression
of several adipogenic genes in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line and several
anti-inflammatory genes in A549 cells [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. CCAR1 and each of the nine other coregulators had distinct patterns
of action on the adipogeneic and anti-inflammatory genes, with CCAR1 exhibiting
the strongest differential specificity among these two pathways. CCAR1 was
required for dex-induced expression of adipogenic genes but not for induction of
the anti-inflammatory genes by dex. We also found that CCAR1 was required for
differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cells to mature adipocytes in response to an
adipogenic cocktail that includes dex. Combined with our current findings, these
two studies indicate that CCAR1 was important for dex actions in adipogenesis
but not for anti-inflammatory actions of dex. These results suggest that CCAR1
may prove to be an attractive target to prevent some side effects of
glucocorticoids when employed clinically for extended treatment regimens.</p><p>Glucocorticoids regulate thousands of genes in various cell types, with different
subsets of these genes belonging to the different glucocorticoid-regulated
physiological pathways. If the gene-specific actions of coregulators do indeed
correlate with specific physiological pathways, as suggested by our data and
several previous studies, then regulating the activity of specific coregulators
provides a potential mechanism for the cell to modulate the hormone response.
This could be accomplished by modulation of signaling pathways that regulate the
protein levels, protein-protein interactions, or post-translational
modifications of specific coregulators. For the same reason, coregulators could
prove to be attractive therapeutic targets for ameliorating side effects of
hormone therapy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This work was supported in part by grant DK043093 to MRS from the National Institutes
