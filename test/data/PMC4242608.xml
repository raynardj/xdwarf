With diagnostic measures and clinically used protease inhibitors focusing on HIV-1, due to its higher virulence and prevalence, studies of the efficacy of those inhibitors on HIV-2 protease remain widely lacking. Utilizing a wild-type HIV-2 vector backbone and cloning techniques we have developed a cassette system where the efficacy of clinically used protease inhibitors can be studied for various serotypes of HIV-2 protease both in enzymatic and cell culture assays. In our experiments, optimization of the expression protocol led to a relatively stable enzyme, for cell culture assays, the efficiency of transfection and transduction capability of the modified vector was tested and was not found to differ from that of the wild-type, moreover, a 2<sup>nd</sup> generation protease inhibitor was used to demonstrate the usefulness of the system. The combination of assays performed with our cassette system is expected to provide an accurate measure of the efficacy of currently used; as well as experimental protease inhibitors on HIV-2.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the T&#x000c1;MOP 4.2.2.A-11/1/KONV-2012-0023 "V&#x000c9;D-ELEM" project and by the Hungarian Science and Research Fund (K-101591 to J.T.).

Bearing a striking genomic resemblance to HIV-1, HIV-2 harbors a distinct clinical feature in that it is less infectious, less pathogenic and has a much lower rate of progression into AIDS <xref rid="pone.0113221-Bock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>; moreover, HIV-2 has a much lower prevalence than its counter-part and has been localized mainly in a region confined to Western Africa. All those features have led to protease inhibitors (PIs) being designed specifically for HIV-1, with the majority of studies focusing on the efficacy of those inhibitors in association with HIV-1 protease, assuming that the inhibitors might have equal efficacy on both proteases <xref rid="pone.0113221-MenendezArias1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and that inadvertently had led to a scarcity in the field of studies of those inhibitors in association with HIV-2 protease. Molecular clock analysis studies have traced the origin of HIV-2 to the region of Guinea-Bissau as a result of an evolution from the simian immunodeficiency virus/sooty mangabeys <xref rid="pone.0113221-Lemey1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. So far eight groups of HIV-2 have been described in the literature and designated alphabetical letters A-H <xref rid="pone.0113221-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113221-Damond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> with groups A and B gaining a wide international spread whereas the other subtypes remain relatively constrained in the West African region. The ending of the colonial era, population migration and international trade have all been implicated in the worldwide spread of HIV-2, especially in Europe, with countries such as France and Portugal reporting the incidence of HIV-2 being continuously on the rise <xref rid="pone.0113221-Soriano1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113221-Barin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, while a slow decline in prevalence in West Africa being attributed to the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 has been observed <xref rid="pone.0113221-Damond2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113221-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Similar to that of HIV-1, HIV-2 protease is also a homodimeric aspartyl enzyme that is comprised of two identical monomers, each containing 99 amino acid residue, playing a vital role in the HIV life-cycle through processing of Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol precursor polyproteins leading to viral maturation. The literature describes a 39&#x02013;48% similarity of amino acid sequences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases <xref rid="pone.0113221-MenendezArias1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113221-Gustchina1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, depending on the virus subtype being studied. This polymorphism greatly affects the specificity of the protease for peptide substrates and inhibitors, hence leading to drug resistance <xref rid="pone.0113221-Tozser1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113221-Damond3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and may render an otherwise very potent inhibitor on HIV-1 protease obsolete. Despite the seemingly significant sequence differences between HIV-1 and -2 protease, the major structural elements around the active site remain highly conserved <xref rid="pone.0113221-Gustchina1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and PI-associated mutations in HIV-2 having relatively high frequency are perhaps natural polymorphisms in their respective strains <xref rid="pone.0113221-Pieniazek1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In comparison to HIV-1, fewer studies have examined the efficacy of clinically used protease inhibitors on HIV-2, moreover, researches have focused on either enzymatic <xref rid="pone.0113221-Brower1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture studies on protease inhibitors in regards to HIV-2 <xref rid="pone.0113221-Ntemgwa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113221-Desbois1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113221-Rodes1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and significantly different IC50 and Ki results can be obtained in these assays. In kinetic assays, the results are highly influenced by the level of purity and degree of stability of the enzyme, results obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture experiments on the other hand, are dependent on the nature of assay used and the types of cells under study. In addition, even a slight variation in the protease coding sequence may alter the results dramatically due to a variation of folding and stability of the enzyme; hence the use of different protease sequences may yield variable results. The lack of a standardized protocol to examine the efficacy of protease inhibitors remains as a hindrance in the analysis, therefore, development of a cassette system that facilitates the analysis of the potency of protease inhibitors on the same protease coding sequence both in kinetic and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture assays will greatly aid the determination of the PI's efficacy, and may help the design of inhibitors being more potent on HIV-2 protease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>HIV-2 vector system</title><p>The vector system is composed of HIV-2CGP as a structural protein expression construct, CRU5SINCGW a minimal HIV-2 vector with GFP expression cassette and pMD.G vector, coding for the envelope protein of vesicular stomatitis virus.

It is also noteworthy that the percentage of positive GFP cells was related directly to the concentration of recombinant virus used. In our experiments, transduction was merely used as a measure to compare the modified vector to the wild-type, the 20&#x02013;25% efficiency was calculated as the percentage of GFP positive cells detected by flow cytometry, as a result of using the same concentration of viruses to transduce 293T cells in a 96-wells plate.</p><p>The vector used is an HIV-2 based self-inactivating vector, due to alterations of the LTR regions. As a result, there is a loss of transcriptional activity following genome integration into target cells, rendering the virus capable of only a single round of replication, therefore, due to the fact that the viral protease is essential to the processing of the viral polyproteins in the late stage of infection, inhibition profiling of protease inhibitors was performed in the virus production stage, using reverse transcriptase as a measurement to detect the efficacy of the PI. To support our methodology, previous studies had shown that the protease is required for the full activity of the reverse transcriptase <xref rid="pone.0113221-Ashorn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, thus, using protease inhibitors at this stage is expected to result in the formation of immature, non-infectious virus particles, with decreased RT activity; depending on the concentration of PI used. Levels of RT can then be detected by the reverse transcriptase colorometric assay, and provide a valid IC50 values for various PIs.</p><p>In single cycle phenotypic assays, commonly, either luciferase activity or GFP fluorescence can be measured after infection of target cells, alternatively, RT activity can be quantified from the supernatant, as a measure of mature, infectious particles <xref rid="pone.0113221-Ntemgwa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113221-Mukherjee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113221-Petropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We chose to detect RT since it is a significantly more sensitive measure as compared to GFP fluorescence.</p><p>To provide a purified enzyme for the kinetic analysis, the protease from the CGP plasmid was amplified and ligated into the expression vector pET11a. After expression in E. <italic>coli</italic>, the protease was purified using HPLC with the aid of a C18 column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113221-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To determine the activity of the purified protease, it was incubated with an oligopeptide substrate MSLNL&#x02193;PVAKV representing the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site in HIV-2 (arrow marks the site of cleavage) and HPLC was used to analyze the cleavage products as described previously <xref rid="pone.0113221-Tozser2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Based on the protein content and activity of the protease samples, the folding efficiency was approximated to be 10&#x02013;15%. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the modular system, a second generation PI (darunavir) was used for kinetic and cell culture inhibition, HPLC measurements performed in triplicates were used to determine the IC50 which was found to be 0.002 (&#x000b1;0.0001) &#x000b5;M that is equivalent to Ki&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 (&#x000b1;0.005) nM values, while experiments done <italic>in vitro</italic> using cultured cells yielded an IC50 of 0.42 (&#x000b1;0.05) &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113221-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Following its dissociation, this autolytic ability of the viral protease also plays a major role in its autodegradation. It is thought that this degradation occurs initially at an exposed amino-terminal strand/loop that is likely to be exposed to the protease in case of HIV-1/2 and SIV <xref rid="pone.0113221-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Autodegradation is a major factor in the attributed loss of activity of the viral enzyme, a process that had proven to be a major hindrance in the expression and purification of the enzyme. Methods aimed at decreasing the autodegradation have been used such as the use of catalytic-site inhibitors, storing the protease at a suboptimal pH, or modifying the implicated amino acid cleavage sites (Leu5-Trp6 in case of HIV-1), which has been found to be more resistant to autodegradation in HIV-2 <xref rid="pone.0113221-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>In our activity analysis of the protease, we have found that incubation in a buffer having a neutral pH greatly decreases its autodegradation/autoinactivation, as evident from our comparative analysis with incubation in an acidic (pH 5.0) buffer that was typically used previously to dialyze HIV proteases. When the activity of the enzyme was monitored, the protease in the buffer having neutral pH maintained almost half of its activity after a 24 hour incubation period at 37 &#x000b0;C, in contrast to incubation at pH 5.0, which yielded minimal activity after only 12 hours of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113221-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As the SDS-gel analysis did not show substantial protein degradation following either refolding protocol, the loss of enzymatic activity appears to be majorly the consequence of autoinactivation rather than autodegradation. We also found that the immediate lyophilization and storage in a pH 7.0 buffer after reversed-phase chromatography aided greatly in the preservation of its activity, and facilitated the prolonged storage and studies on the purified fractions (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0113221-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113221.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Studies on autodegradation of HIV-2 protease.</title><p>
