of badminton players by comparing them between those with high and low performance levels.
[Subjects] Eight male badminton players belonging to teams ranked among the top 3 at the
All Japan Badminton Championships (high-level group) and 8 playing badminton for
recreation in university clubs (low-level group) were studied. [Methods] CoG sway during
two- and one (dominant and non-dominant)-leg standing with the eyes open and closed were
recorded for 30 seconds, using a stabilometer. [Results] With their eyes open, the CoG was
maintained near the center by the high-level group, while it was displaced in the
direction of the dominant leg by the low-level group, with a significant difference
between the two groups. In contrast, with the eyes closed, the trace length, sway area,
and X- and Y-axis sway amplitudes were greater in the low- than in high-level group, with
significant differences between the two groups. [Conclusion] These results support the
usefulness of standing on the non-dominant leg with the eyes closed for the evaluation of
badminton players&#x02019; balance ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Badminton player</kwd><kwd>Center of gravity</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To win a badminton game, players need to effectively deliver shots to disrupt opponent&#x02019;s
readiness and dominate rallies. Previous studies of badminton games have reported the
development of skills to deliver effective service and overhead strokes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> performing smashes
and the characteristics of upper-limb muscle activity in high-level badminton players<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. To disrupt an opponent&#x02019;s readiness by
effectively delivering a shot, players need to instantaneously predict the spot where the
shuttlecock will fall. In addition, increased leg strength for rapid movement to the spot
where the shuttlecock falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
endurance to continue to move without decreasing the speed of movement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> are important
factors. It is also necessary for badminton players to move with a stable stance, while
maintaining their own readiness. In this respect, balance ability is likely to markedly
influence badminton player&#x02019;s performance levels.</p><p>Balance ability is associated with multiple factors, including visual information; for
example, greater fluctuations in the center of gravity (CoG) are observed when standing with
the eyes closed than with them open<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
There has also been a report suggesting that the CoG fluctuates less with increased
lower-limb muscle strength<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For postural
stability, the appropriate contraction of lower-limb muscles based on sensory information
obtained through the plantar surface is necessary<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In short, balance ability is influenced by various factors, and
balance improvement is crucial for skill advancement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. With poor balance ability, postural stability decreases,
consequently increasing the load on the lower limbs. In badminton, the physical burden has
been reported to be marked<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the rate
of injury to be high<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it
is important to reduce the risk of injury and increase the performance level by enhancing
balance ability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, to return
a shuttlecock falling near the net, players lunge forward mainly by moving their dominant
legs. This pattern of movement places a great burden on the muscles of the dominant leg, and
is frequently executed in badminton games. It is likely to be a characteristic of badminton,
as it is not observed in other sports. On the other hand, when the shuttlecock falls in the
back section of the court, players jump off the dominant or non-dominant leg to return it on
some occasions. In short, badminton is characterized by the execution of combined jumping
and stepping movements, and, in this respect, badminton players&#x02019; balance ability is likely
to be under the influence of these combined movement patterns. However, badminton players&#x02019;
balance ability has not yet been fully examined.</p><p>Considering the importance of addressing this issue in terms of injury prevention and
performance improvement, this study aimed to clarify the characteristics of CoG sway in
badminton players by comparing them between players with high and low performance
levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Eight male badminton players (high-level group) belonging to teams ranked among the top 3

The leg on the side on which they gripped the racket was considered the
dominant limb. All subjects were provided with explanations regarding the study&#x02019;s objectives
and safety before obtaining their consent to voluntarily participate in the measurements.
This study was conducted with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the Health
Science University (approval number: 15).</p><p>CoG sway during two- and one (dominant and non-dominant)-leg standing with subject&#x02019;s eyes
open and closed were recorded using a stabilometer (WBS-1NK, UNIMEX Inc.). To maintain the
posture during measurement, the subjects were positioned in a space surrounded by white
walls, and were instructed to fix their eyes on a target placed 2&#x02005;m ahead at their eye
level. In the comparison of the high- and low-level groups, the possible influence of the
body height on CoG sway was considered insignificant, as there were no marked differences
between the groups in height.</p><p>CoG sway in each stance was recorded at a sampling frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz for 30 seconds. The
obtained data were analyzed using sway analysis software (COG-samp Version 2.00) to
calculate the following 5 items: (1) the total CoG sway path length, (2) CoG sway path
length per unit area, (3) CoG sway area, (4) X- and Y-axis CoG sway amplitudes, and (5) mean
X- and Y-axis center displacements. Item (1) is the total length of the CoG sway path during
the 30 seconds of measurement, and (2) was obtained by dividing 1) by 3), (3) being the area
surrounded by the circumference of the CoG sway path. (4) are the amplitudes of CoG sway in
the horizontal and anteroposterior directions, and (5) indicates the mean center
displacements in these directions, respectively. Furthermore, the positive and negative
directions along the X-axis represent CoG displacements in the directions of the dominant
and non-dominant legs, respectively, and those of the Y-axis represent the ventral and
dorsal directions, respectively.</p><p>Student&#x02019;s t-test was used to examine the significance of differences between the high- and
low-level groups. Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>CoG sway when players stood on two legs with their eyes open and closed</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Standing on two legs</th><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1">With eyes open</th><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1">With eyes closed</th></tr><tr><th colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High-level group</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low-level group</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Significant<break/>difference</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High-level group</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low-level group</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Significant<break/>difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total CoG sway path (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.9&#x000b1;6.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.3&#x000b1;6.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.3&#x000b1;8.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.6&#x000b1;6.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sway area (cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.7&#x000b1;9.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.1&#x000b1;12.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.2&#x000b1;27.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.0&#x000b1;16.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trace length per unit area (cm/cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X-axis sway amplitude (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.3&#x000b1;3.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.4&#x000b1;3.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.6&#x000b1;6.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.9&#x000b1;4.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Y-axis sway amplitude (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.0&#x000b1;5.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.7&#x000b1;5.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.9&#x000b1;6.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.3&#x000b1;5.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean X-axis center displacement (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.2&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">*</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.1&#x000b1;0.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6&#x000b1;0.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Y-axis center displacement (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.0&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.5&#x000b1;1.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.1&#x000b1;1.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.2&#x000b1;2.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*: p&#x0003c;0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the CoG sway when the badminton players stood on two legs with their

levels, Our results show that when the badminton players stood on two or the dominant leg
with their eyes open, the CoG was maintained near the center by the high-level group, while
it was displaced toward the dominant leg or in the dorsal direction by the low-level group
and when standing on the non-dominant leg with the eyes closed, the total CoG trace length
markedly increased in the low-level group.</p><p>It has been reported that postural maintenance when standing depends on muscle strength,
sensory functions, such as the somatic and visual senses, and complex interactions of the
spinal reflex and vestibular system<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
For example, the otolith and semicircular canals in the inner ear (the vestibular system),
sensory organs perceiving the positions of the head and body, are involved in postural
maintenance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, as CoG sway
are generally greater when standing with the eyes closed than open, the availability of
visual information also markedly influences balance ability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rooks et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the elderly&#x02019;s balance ability was improved by resistance training to enhance
their muscle strength, suggesting that muscle strength is an important factor for postural
maintenance. In agreement with this, the variations in CoG sway and displacements observed
in the present study are likely to have reflected differences in the functions associated
with the balance ability of the subjects; however, as none of the previous studies of
badminton players compared the vision and sensory organs of subjects with different
performance levels, it is difficult to discuss whether such functional differences led to
the variations in CoG sway found between the high- and low-level groups in the present
study. Also, considering that badminton players with high performance levels have been
reported to have greater lower-limb muscle strength<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is possible that differences in the muscle strength influenced
the variations in CoG sway between them. However, as Wolfson et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that improvement was not observed, even with
increased muscle strength, the degree of such influences may not be marked. In short,
variations in CoG sway due to differences in performance level are likely to be associated
with differences in the central nervous activities, responsible for integrating sensory
information and generating motor commands, although measurements of such
performance-dependent differences in central nervous activity were not made in the present
study. In some previous studies, experience-related functional changes were observed even in
the spinal neurons with poor plasticity. The H-reflex is frequently used to evaluate stretch
as a spinal reflex, and has been reported to show sport-specific changes. For example, the
soleus H-reflex is greater in swimmers than in non-swimmers<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, while the H-reflex level is lower in professional ballet dancers
than in general athletes<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fact that
long-term physical training leads to specific and plastic changes in the central nervous
system is widely recognized, and, in this respect, we speculate that the variations in CoG
sway observed in the present study may have been associated with experience-related
differences in central nervous activity, even though measurements in relation to this were
not made.</p><p>In the present study, when badminton players stood on two or the dominant leg with their
eyes open, the CoG was maintained near the center by the high-level group, while it was
displaced toward the dominant leg or in the dorsal direction by the low-level group. In
badminton, to return a shuttlecock falling near the net, players need to adopt a lunge
position with the dominant leg forward. This pattern of movement places a greater burden on
the dominant than on the non-dominant leg, and is a characteristic of badminton, which
presumably results in CoG displacement toward the dominant leg. On the other hand, players
need to maintain their CoG near the center of the body to be ready to move in any direction
after returning the shuttlecock despite the lateral difference, and this may explain the
result that the CoG was maintained near the center by the high-level group. In addition, the
marked increase in the total CoG trace length by the low-level group when standing on the
non-dominant leg with their eyes closed (without visual information) may also be regarded as
an experience-related tendency. In general, afferent information plays an important role in
the motor learning process, but its contribution significantly decreases after learning<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, assuming that there were
marked differences in the experience of standing on the non-dominant leg between the high-
and low-level groups, the lack of visual information may not have affected the former with
such experience. This tendency may also be associated with an ability to appropriately
return a shuttlecock falling near the non-dominant leg.</p><p>In badminton players instantaneously react to the shuttlecock and rapidly move to it
throughout the game. The player&#x02019;s physical burden is marked<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the rate of injury is high<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to prevent injury, it is important to improve badminton
players&#x02019; balance ability, and therefore, establish methods to objectively evaluate it.
Although the results of this study may be insufficient in some respects, they support the
appropriateness of evaluating balance based on the characteristics of CoG sway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Research Grant from the Health Science University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tzetzis</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Votsis</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Three feedback methods in acquisition and retention of
