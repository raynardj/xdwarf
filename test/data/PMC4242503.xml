<italic>Background</italic>
</title><p>In the context of multiple adversities, women are demonstrating resilience in rebuilding their futures, through participation in microfinance programs. In addition to the economic benefits of microfinance, there is evidence to suggest that it is an effective vehicle for improving health.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Methods</italic>
</title><p>The parent study is a community-based trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a livestock microfinance intervention, Pigs for Peace (PFP), on health and economic outcomes with households in 10 villages in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The analysis for this manuscript includes only baseline data from female participants enrolled in the ongoing parent study. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine if livestock/animal asset value moderates the relationship between conflict-related traumatic events and current mental health symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Findings</italic>
</title><p>The majority of women are 25 years or older, married, have on average 4 children in the home and have never attended school. Nearly 50% of women report having at least one livestock/animal asset at baseline. Over the past 10 years, women report on average more than 4 (M&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.31, SD 3&#x000b7;64) traumatic events (range 0&#x02013;18). Women reported symptoms consistent with PTSD with a mean score of &#x000b7;2.30 (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;66range 0&#x02013;4) and depression with a mean score of 1.86 (SD &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;49, range 0&#x02013;3.47). The livestock/animal asset value by conflict-related traumatic events interaction was significant for both the PTSD (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;021) and depression (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;002) symptom models.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Interpretation</italic>
</title><p>The study provides evidence of the moderating affect of livestock/animal assets on mental health symptoms for women who have experienced conflict. The findings supports evidence about the importance of livestock/animal assets to economics in rural households but expands on previous research by demonstrating the psychosocial effects of these assets on women's health.</p></sec><sec><title>

Ten rural villages of Walungu Territory (located between 40&#x02013;80 km from the capital of South Kivu province) were selected for participation in PFP based on: 1) feasibility of delivering a microfinance intervention over a wide geographic area with limited infrastructure; 2) commitment to the livestock microfinance approach and study by traditional chiefs and administrators; and 3) findings related to existence of other microfinance initiatives and social programs, village security and poverty from village-level assessments including review of administrative data and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. Adults, aged 16 years and older, were eligible for the study if they expressed a commitment to and understanding of microfinance principles (e.g. repayment of loan), were permanent residents of one of the ten participating villages and were responsible individuals in the household (e.g., married 16 year old, 16 year old responsible for younger siblings because of death of parent, widowed adult).

The PFP microfinance approach uses pigs as a loan because livestock/animals are an important source of economic security and status, similar to a savings account, in rural villages and there are no cultural or religious taboos or gender-based responsibilities related to raising a pig. Each PFP member household cares for their pig including building a pigpen and providing adequate nutrition, health care and supervision with support from PFP agents. When the pig gives birth, members repay their pig loan in the form of two piglets, which are then used to provide new pig loans in the same village. After repaying their loan, the remaining piglets and the original female pig is the households to continue to raise, breed and/or sell. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>

Among those with children, the median number of children under the age of 18 years in the household is 4. Over 68% of women reported that they had never attended school. The majority of women (95%) reported that their home was made of non-durable materials (mud/clay); only 5.5% of houses were made of wood/brick. Village houses made of durable materials; such as wood/brick or tin sheets is a proxy of access to disposable income to purchase products to build durable homes. Further, less than 40% of households had roofing from durable material (e.g., tin sheets) with most women reporting living in homes with roofs made of dried leaves or grass. Few women reported that their household had savings (less than 5%) and less than one-quarter (23.0%) of women reported that they had regular paid work, such as being a porter or vendor in the market, domestic servant or farm hand. Almost 50% of women perceived that their household was worse off financially than other households.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0111708-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111708.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participant Characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0111708-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0111708.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Demographics</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

Specifically, as the livestock/animal assets increase, the impact of conflict-related traumatic events on symptoms consistent with PTSD and depression are reduced. The findings supports existing evidence about the importance of livestock/animal assets to economics in rural households but expands on previous research by demonstrating the psychosocial effects of livestock/animal assets on health. Livestock/animal assets extend beyond its association with wealth, as other measures of wealth used to assess household economic security (e.g., durable housing, savings, regular work) did not buffer the effect of conflict-related traumatic events on symptoms consistent with PTSD and depression for women. Women report using the funds gained through the livestock/animal microfinance to pay for school fees, purchase land and materials to build/repair homes, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> thus potentially strengthening self-perception of status as well as the household's and larger communities perception of the woman's productivity and status. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Maass1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>
</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa and DRC, household needs are often complex due to large family size and the support given to extended family, for example - the median household size in the current study is five people, with on average of 4 children under the age of 18 years, and women report frequent food insecurity, eating only one meal a day. In post-conflict settings such as DRC, the direct (e.g. physical and sexual violence) and indirect (lack of educational and health system) effects of conflict further impact a woman's productivity, health, economic security and status. In resource limited and conflict-affected rural milieu like DRC, community-based livestock/animal microfinance interventions present a culturally acceptable intervention that can simultaneously provide psychosocial support to address mental health needs for women while supplementing family economic security.</p><p>Most rural households globally rely on subsistence farming to ensure food security and animal husbandry to obtain wealth and status in the village. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Nanama1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> In rural DRC, livestock production may continue to be one of the few economic opportunities available to villagers to accumulate needed resources to rebuild their household wealth and social status. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Cox2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> Livestock such as pigs are traditional rural assets, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Maass1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Zozo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and, therefore, not intended for regular food consumption but serve as a &#x0201c;savings account&#x0201d; for economic opportunities and crises. Livestock/animals are visible symbols of productivity and social status, and their possession influences the owners' positive perception of self and household wealth. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Maass1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Zozo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> As an animal that can be raised, bred and sold by women in DRC, pigs importantly represent a gender-neutral intervention in eastern DRC that can bring adult men and women together to improve social, health and economic outcomes for their family. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Mupawaenda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>
</p><p>To address unmet mental health care needs of a post-conflict setting, Bass and colleagues (2013) conducted a study with female sexual violence survivors in Eastern DRC to examine the effectiveness of an adaptation of group cognitive processing therapy (CPT) provided by community-based psychosocial assistants supervised by psychosocial staff at an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) and by US-based clinical experts. <xref rid="pone.0111708-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> The findings indicate that psychosocial assistants (lay health workers) with appropriate training and supervision can implement psychotherapeutic treatments such as CPT. The study provided impressive findings of the effect of CPT on mental health for sexual violence survivors, the sustainability of the CPT intervention approach is a challenge for low-resource, rural settings where women have experienced different and multiple conflict-related traumatic events.</p><p>In DRC, as in many low-resource countries, there continues to be a lack of government funded health centers with human resources that have training in psychotherapeutic treatment such as CPT to provide ongoing supervision and support for lay health care workers (e.g., psychosocial assistants). For example, it is estimated that DRC has 0.07 psychiatrists working in mental health sector per 100,000 population. <xref rid="pone.0111708-World1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> Further, DRC's approved mental health policy (passed in year 1999) does not allow primary care nurses to diagnose or treat mental health problems, so it is unclear if the role of the lay health care worker in the provision of services is an accepted practice by the DRC government and if accepted who will provide ongoing supervision in rural areas. <xref rid="pone.0111708-World1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> In addition, there does not appear to be an established funding source and training curriculum for the psychosocial assistants supported by the national or local government, as the WHO mental health atlas (2011) reported that the majority of primary health care doctors and nurses have not received official in-service training on mental health within the last five years and approved manuals on the management and treatment of mental disorders are not available in the majority of primary health care clinics. Although the evidence supports the potential of CPT to provide psychosocial support to survivors of sexual violence, expanding into rural areas with limited infrastructure will likely take significant, ongoing international resources that are becoming continually difficult to access given the multiple and protracted global conflicts. Further, existing CPT interventions are often focused on a singular traumatic event (e.g. sexual violence) and diagnostic criteria, and therefore evidence for scaling up the intervention to address the multiple traumatic events experienced by women over a prolonged conflict is unclear.</p><p>The PFP model, which was collaboratively developed by the target community, provides support for the importance of indigenous expertise in developing and implementing sustainable programs to improve mental health in post-conflict areas. PAIDEK's microfinance model of engaging traditional leaders and community members in productive and culturally appropriate economic activities that engage both men and women in rural areas, <xref rid="pone.0111708-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> where most international organizations do not have sustainable access or trained staff to provide ongoing health and economic programs, is critical to ending a dependence on international humanitarian aid and progress to long-term development initiatives that will advance wealth and status of women and rural household members, with the positive effect of buffering negative mental health symptoms. It is certain that livestock/animal microfinance alone will not solve the multiple economic, health and social challenges facing women and families in low resources conflict and post-conflict settings. However, integrating collaboratively developed and culturally relevant economic initiatives while strengthening health care and social systems in rural areas are critical steps towards sustainable development.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The cross-sectional analysis limits the teams' ability to determine causality. The analysis presented here provides initial evidence for a culturally acceptable village based livestock/animal microfinance intervention to buffer the mental health effects of traumatic events on women. Exposure to traumatic events represents a history of exposure within the past 10 years, representing the multiple periods of conflict in the Walungu Territory. Some of these experiences were likely to be in the recent past and others several years prior to interviews, so recall bias is a potential issue. In spite of these limitations, this study has particular strengths. Firstly, the innovative approach of promoting resilience in a situation of social upheaval, secondly, the integration of conceptual elements of addressing both health and economic security and thirdly the importance of partnering with a well-established and respected Congolese-led microfinance organization (PAIDEK) with an ability to engage in sustained partnerships with village leaders to implement PFP. This study has adopted both innovative conceptual and methodological processes to advance evidence to achieve scalability and sustainability to address social, cultural and economic factors associated with poor health for women in conflict-affected rural villages.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings contributes to the science base for large-scale implementation of sustainable, community-led animal/livestock economic programs that not only increase household wealth and status, but improve health in areas where women and other household members have extremely limited access to high quality health and social services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111708.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
