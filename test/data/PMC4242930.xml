lipids of obese women. [Subjects] The subjects were 24 clinically obese women. [Methods]
The subjects were divided into an exercise group (n=12), and a control group (n=12). The
exercise group performed exercise for 10 weeks with diet restriction. We investigated how
this type of exercise influenced blood lipids. Blood was taken before and after the
intervention. The collected blood was centrifuged at 3,000&#x02005;rpm for 10 minutes; and plasma
was preserved at &#x02212;73&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. For hemanalysis, a medical laboratory was asked to analyze total
cholesterol and triglyceride. The exercise was performed 5 times per week, and an exercise
was performed every two days, and exercise program was composed of warm up, main exercise
and cool down. [Results] There were significant differences between the two groups in
blood lipid levels after the intervention. The differences between the two groups in TC
and TG were significant. [Conclusion] TC and TG significantly inproved in the experimental
group showing that the exercise was effective at improveing blood lipid levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Blood lipid</kwd><kwd>Obese</kwd><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regular exercise improves the blood lipids and has a positive effect on endothelial cells
of the blood vessel, eventually slowing down or preventing progress of the arteriosclerosis.
As therapies for obesity, dietary therapy, exercise therapy, medicinal therapy, and behavior
therapy have been used and among then exercise therapy is the most economical, safe, and
fundamental treatment of all obesity treatments<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, a clinical survey reported that 67.5% of patients with
obesity lacked exercise, and overweight persons were found among those who work for a long
time sitting on a chair<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings
demonstrate how physical activity is related to obesity. Dietary therapy is a treatment
which controls only calorie intake. It has a big effect on weight-loss in a short period of
time, but this can cause several problems, such as decrease in lean body mass (LBM) due to
loss of muscular tissues, a decline in the basal metabolic rate (BMR) at rest, and the
induction of myofunctional disorder<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Resistance weight training was to have a positive effect on the reduction of body fat by
increasing muscle tissues maintaining of muscular strength, increasing in fat-free mass; and
reducing blood lipids and lipoprotein metabolism, emphasizing the importance of resistance
weight training as an effective method for weight control. Furthermore, controlling
inter-set rest times during weight training significantly affected blood lipid
concentrations and body construction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weight training also improves the insulin reaction, increases bone density or prevents its
loss, and reduces the loss of muscle mass and muscular strength which accompanies aging<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, weight training has also been
reported to increase muscle strength and the cross-sectional area of muscle not only in men,
but also in women in middle and old age. Accordingly, it is desirable that an exercise
program for the most safe and efficient weight loss should be composed of a combination
aerobic exercise with resistance weight training tailrored to the subject&#x02019;s level. In a
recent study, a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance weight training performed by
middle-aged women with obesity was found to have a positive effect on body composition and
blood lipids<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported the importance of dietary therapy as well as
exercise therapy, and stated that exercise therapy without considering dietary therapy would
not reduce body fat<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A few findings have recently been reported regarding the effects of exercise on women with
obesity accompanying adult diseases and illnesses. However, they are insufficient and
further, more specific and diverse experiments and researches are necessary into how dietary
exercises can be combined to create an ideal exercise program tailored to personal
characteristics. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exercise therapy on
blood lipids of obese women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 24 women with no habit of regular exercise (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(%fat)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.3&#x000b1;7.34</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">152.2&#x000b1;8.11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.9&#x000b1;3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.4&#x000b1;9.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.5&#x000b1;8.41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">154.5&#x000b1;6.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.2&#x000b1;2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.5&#x000b1;10.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>). They were selected using bioelectrical impedance measures which showed they
had body fat percentages of over 30%. None of the subjects had high blood pressure or
diabetes and none had performed systematic exercise for at least 3 months. The subjects were
divided into an group (n=12), which performed an exercise program for 10 weeks, and a
control group (n=12), which performed no exercise. The subjects of the exercise group
performed exercise for 10 weeks diet restriction, and we investigated how this type of
exercise influenced on blood lipids; consequently aiming at preparing a basic data for
designing appropriate and developmental exercise methods and programs to treat obesity to
reduce the risk of developing coronary diseases. Blood was taken before and after the
intervention by a nurse. The collected blood was centrifuged at 3,000&#x02005;rpm for 10 minutes and
the plasma was preserved at &#x02212;73&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. For hemanalysis, a medical laboratory was asked to
analyze total cholesterol and triglyceride. All experiments were reviewed and approved by
the Committee of the Honam University. The purpose and procedure of the study were explained
to the subjects who voluntarily signed an informed consent agreement before participating in
the experiment.</p><p>For the exercise load test of this study, all the subjects arrived at the laboratory 40
minutes before the experiment. They performed 10 minutes warm-up and 10 minutes treadmill
workout then took a rest of 20 minutes before the main test. The maximum exercise load test
was conducted at 70% of HRmax using the Modified Bruce Protocol in order to individually set
the exercise intensity to HRmax of 70%. In the treadmill exercise load test, the heart rate
was measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG) in real time, and the blood pressure (BP) was
recorded by an automatic sphygmomanometer with a BP cuff applied to the arm, and set to
automatically measure BP at 3-minute intervals. In the recovery period after finishing the
treadmill exercise at 70% of HRmax, BP was measured and recorded at intervals of 2 minutes.
The aerobic exercise program was performed on a treadmill. All the subjects performed
exercise for 30 minutes using a treadmill load speed and gradient corresponding to HRmax of
50%. Blood was collected when a stable condition, had been established and the subjects were
prohibited from taking any food, smoke, drinks, or hard exercise from 10 o&#x02019;clock on the
night before the test day. Approximately 5&#x02005;ml of blood were taken from the antecubital
vein.</p><p>The aerobic-exercise method of this study was determined based on exercise prescriptions,
of intensity, frequency and time of exercise suggested by ACSM (2009), after implementing an
exercise load test. The type of exercise was walking at a quick pace, and the intensity of
exercise was low intensity, long-term exercise, rather than high intensity, short-term
exercise, with an HRmax of 40&#x02013;60%. The intensity of exercise was watched by using the Polar
heart rate checker in order to check the subject&#x02019;s exercise intensity.</p><p>The exercise was performed 5 times per week, and the exercise program was composed of 5&#x02005;min
warm up, 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;min main exercise and 5&#x02005;min cool down. The control group did no exercise
during the experimental period.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Ver. 18.0 for Windows. ANCOVA was utilized
to test the significance of differences in the variables between before and after the
exercise program lasting 10 weeks. Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The blood lipid values and statistics of the exercise group and the control group are

control and exercise have complementary roles needs to be conducted. There are many studies
which have established the relation between exercise and blood lipid levels<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In particular, obesity is known to show a higher risk of lipid metabolism disorder than
normal. Cholesterol is one of the lipids, and is widely used as a index for verifying,
treating and determining hyperlipidemia<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study which was conducted to measure, TC, and it showed a
significant improve in the exercise group, whereas the control group displayed a
non-significant. An aerobic program for women with obesity was conducted at the maximum
heart rate of 60&#x02013;80%, 5 times a week for 50 minutes, and TC and TG showed a significant
decreases<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. TC and TG are the most
common lipids, covering 98&#x02013;99% of all naturally occurring lipids in nature. They are mainly
stored in the liver and subcutaneous fat; is produced in fat tissues and the liver. The TG
which is stored in fat tissues is rapidly metabolized when sugar runs short as energy
source. Exercises were reported to facilitate fat utilization rate in exercise by increasing
mitochondria in the skeletal muscle, promoting oxidation ability, and inhibiting the use of
glycogen. It reduces body fat by decreasing TG and activating catabolic enzyme for
lipoprotein, thus enabling fat to be used as an energy source.</p><p>In a study of exercise performed by female college students, both the group of diet therapy
and aerobic exercise and the group of diet therapy and circuit weight training showed a
significant decreases in TG<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, in an
obesity treatment program, middle-aged women with obesity showed a significant decrease in
TG, after performing for 4 days a week for 16 weeks to burn aerobic exercise and resistance
weight training at 400 Kcal/session<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the present study, TC and TG in the exercise group significantly decreased. This result
suggests that regular exercise should be performed along with an appropriately controlled
diet program in order to improve blood lipid levels<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Women in middle age
facing menopause are encouraged to not only perform exercises, but also run with weight
training to prevent sharp loss of muscle, increase of body fat mass caused by decrease of
metabolism at rest and osteoporosis resulting from decline in bone density, with a view to
health maintenance and obesity management. These days, weight training is becoming popular,
and it is a highly proper training method for promoting the physical strength of men and
women of all ages, and children.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Korea Obesity Academic Society:
