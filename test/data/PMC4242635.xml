However, MSCs isolated from primary tissue cannot meet clinical grade needs and should be expanded in vitro for several passages. Although hMSCs show low possibility for undergoing oncogenic transformation, they do, similar to other somatic cells, undergo cellular senescence and their therapeutic potential is diminished when cultured in vitro. However, the role of senescent MSCs in tumor progression remains largely elusive. In the current study, by establishing senescent human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (s-UCMSCs) through the replicative senescence model and genotoxic stress induced premature senescence model, we show that s-UCMSCs significantly stimulate proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor progression in a co-transplant xenograft mouse model compared with &#x02018;young&#x02019; counterparts (defined as MSCs at passage 5, in contrast to senescent MSCs at passage 45). In addition, we identified IL-6, a known pleiotropic cytokine, as a principal mediator for the tumor-promoting activity of s-UCMSCs by induction of STAT3 phosphorylation. Depletion of IL-6 from s-UCMSCs conditioned medium partially abrogated the stimulatory effect of s-UCMSCs on the proliferation and migration of breast tumor cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Basic Research and Development of China (973 program) (Nos. 2010CB529903, 2010CB833600 and 2012CB518105); the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81201760, 30973670 and 3090592); and the Chinese National Science and Technology Major Project (Nos. 2012ZX09102301-001 and 2011ZX09102-001-30).

In fact, MSCs might enter senescence almost undetectably from the moment in vitro culture begins. Cells display a characteristic enlarged, flattened morphology, slowed proliferation rate, shortened telomere length and alteration of their secretory profile. Simultaneously, MSCs are losing their multipotential characteristics. It has been previously described early on that the differentiation potential to form an osteocyte declines during late-passages, which may be a cause of senile osteoporosis <xref rid="pone.0113572-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Other studies have demonstrated that the impairment on adipogenic potential may be even greater <xref rid="pone.0113572-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

However, whether senescent-related changes in MSCs could alter their interaction within a tumor or comparison between &#x02018;young&#x02019; MSCs and senescent MSCs during mammary carcinoma progression remains inconclusive. In this study, we show that in comparison with &#x02018;young&#x02019; MSCs, senescent human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (s-UCMSCs) significantly promote the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells through the IL-6/STAT-3-dependent pathway.

In contrast to P45-MSCs, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-MSCs were easily to be harvested. In additon, it was demonstrated recently that reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in the tumor microenvironment induces a form of &#x0201c;accelerated aging&#x0201d;, which leads to stromal inflammation and changes in cancer cell metabolism <xref rid="pone.0113572-Lisanti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. So here we used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced MSCs as the senescent cell model. At day 3, it was possible to palpate solid nodules beneath the skin. Interestingly, all the mice (8/8) inject with the senescent MSCs (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced MSCs) developed palpable nodules, whereas only 4/8 and 3/8 of young MSCs (P5-MSC) or control, respectively, could be detected, indicating that senescent MSCs promote tumor initiation. In addition, senescent MSCs not only enhanced tumor formation but also accelerated tumor growth. External caliper measurements showed that MDA231/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-MSCs xenografts were strikingly larger than MDA231/P5-MSCs and MDA231 xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Furthermore, tumor weight of the senescent cell group was significantly higher than the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). We further investigated tumor neovascularization by immunostaining for endothelin-1, an endothelial-specific marker. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g004">Fig. 4B and C</xref>, we noted significant augmentation in vascularization when senescent MSCs were co-injected with MDA-231. In addition, both the number and size of endothelin-1-positive vessels were increased by the co-injection of senescent MSCs.</p><fig id="pone-0113572-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113572.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Senescent MSCs stimulate growth and angiogenesis of breast tumor cells in vivo.</title><p>Tumor volume (A) and final tumor weight (B) were measured as described.

Our data revealed that senescent MSCs develop a characteristic senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent MSCs, much more than pre-senescent counterparts, stimulate proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Moreover, this cancer-promoting activity was due at least in part to the IL-6/STAT-3 signaling pathway.</p><p>With the increased use of MSCs in clinical trials of regenerative medicine and immunomodulatory disorders, the bottleneck for clinical application of MSCs is standardized process of cell preparations and reliable quality control of cell products <xref rid="pone.0113572-Sensebe2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although hMSCs are considered stem cells based on their self-renewing and multi-differentiation capability, they do have a definitive life span and enter into senescence after a certain number of cell divisions. Various critical molecular switches of cellular senescence, such as progressive shortening of telomeres and accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4a, have been demonstrated for MSCs after repeated passage <xref rid="pone.0113572-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Besides the intrinsic factors, the expansion medium and culturing oxygen concentration might also have an enormous impact on the extent of MSCs expansion in vitro <xref rid="pone.0113572-Gharibi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113572-Fecteau1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, the time course of senescence for MSCs varies between different laboratories. Intriguingly, our data revealed that platelet growth factor-enriched human plasma represents an efficient alternative to FCS. MSCs expanded in PL-supplemented medium were prone to maintain stem cell characteristics and retard the aging process, as the typical senescent phenomenon did not arise until 40 passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that MSCs appear to be particularly sensitive to elevated ROS levels <xref rid="pone.0113572-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. ROS, such as oxygen ions, hydroxyl radicals and peroxide, are highly reactive and cause DNA and cell damage. Similarly to fibroblasts, sub-lethal doses of oxidative stress declined proliferation rates and induced senescent morphological features as well as senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). However, the expression level of surface markers for senescent MSCs remained similar to normal MSCs (data not shown), whilst the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>MSCs play a pivotal role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. When recruited into breast tumor stroma, the &#x02018;hijacked&#x02019; MSCs tended to be &#x02018;educated&#x02019; by tumor cells and form a major component of the tumor microenvironment and regulate cancer stem cell behavior <xref rid="pone.0113572-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Bone marrow derived MSCs have been proven to be an important source and contribute 20% to cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) <xref rid="pone.0113572-Quante1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, when exposed to breast tumor conditioned medium, MSCs assume a CAF-like phenotype and gained functional properties of CAFs <xref rid="pone.0113572-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Additionally, MSCs secrete a variety of cytokines and growth factors that are known to influence tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. It has been reported that co-injection of MSCs with weakly metastatic human breast carcinoma cells greatly increase their metastatic potency. Furthermore, the enhanced metastatic ability was dependent on paracrine factor CCL5 <xref rid="pone.0113572-Karnoub1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, tumor-resident MSCs directly impair the function of a variety of immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells <xref rid="pone.0113572-Klopp1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, unlike bone marrow derived MSCs, human UC-MSCs exerts strong inhibitory effect on several types of tumor cells, possibly through downregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling and activation of p38 MAPK pathway <xref rid="pone.0113572-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113572-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrated that the physiological status of UC-MSCs exert crucial influence on its interaction with breast cancer cells. We found that only senescent MSCs showed marked growth and metastasis promotion. In contrast, normal MSCs were only found to create a moderate supportive effect.</p><p>Normal cellular senescence prevents neoplastic transformation of damaged cells by imposing an essentially irreversible growth arrest. Paradoxically, senescent cells also promote neoplastic transformation of neighboring epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0113572-Campisi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Upon senescence, such cells develop a complex SASP. The altered expression of inflammatory factors, growth cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases could disrupt tissue architecture and function, and then, create a microenvironment that facilitates the growth and progression of the mutant epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0113572-Coppe1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, this secretory phenotype resembles that of CAFs, although senescent fibroblasts and CAFs differ in morphology, growth potential and other traits.</p><p>Of the myriad SASP factors associated with inflammation and malignancy, our data revealed that IL-6 is apparently specific for senescent MSCs to promote tumor progression. The IL-6 secretion level of senescent MSCs was found to increase 40 fold, whereas three other cytokines, HGF, VEGF and TNF-&#x003b1;, all of which are closely related to tumor progression, did not show an increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113572-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, conditioned medium from senescent MSCs could activate STAT3, the main downstream transcription factor of IL-6, in breast cancer cells, and the activation could be blocked by an IL-6-neutralizing antibody. Interestingly, previous studies also demonstrated that IL-6 contributes to many age-related pathologies, including late life cancers <xref rid="pone.0113572-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and IL-6 secreted from MSCs has been regarded as a crucial cytokine for breast cancer cell metastasis <xref rid="pone.0113572-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our data suggests that cellular senescence and aging of MSCs is similar to the &#x0201c;The Sword of Damocles&#x0201d; and may jeopardize the use of MSCs for therapeutic purposes. Assessment of the overall senescence status of hMSCs should be implemented before clinical application.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Yang Cai (301 hospital), Yan Sai, Dongmei Liu(Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine) forn their help with animal experiments and statistical analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113572-Pittenger1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
