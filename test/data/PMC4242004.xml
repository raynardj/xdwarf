cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC)
motif is a primary structure pattern used to identify regions that
may be responsible for preferential cholesterol binding in many proteins.
The leukotoxin LtxA, which is produced by a pathogenic bacterium,
contains two CRAC seqences, only one of which is responsible for cholesterol
binding, and the binding is required for cytotoxicity. The factors,
in addition to the CRAC definition, that may be responsible for cholesterol-binding
functionality and atomistic interactions between the CRAC region and
cholesterol are as yet unknown. This study uses molecular dynamics
simulations to identify structural characteristics and specific interactions
of the two LtxA CRAC peptides with both pure phospholipid and binary
cholesterol&#x02013;phospholipid bilayers. We have identified changes
in the secondary structure of these peptides that occur upon cholesterol
binding, which are not seen when it is associated with a cholesterol-devoid
membrane, and which show salient coupling of structural disorder and
function. Additionally, the central tyrosine residue of the CRAC motif
was found to play a significant role in cholesterol binding, though
residues outside of the CRAC motif also influence membrane interactions
and functionality of the CRAC region.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>jp5106423</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>jp-2014-106423</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological membranes
are complex, dynamic systems that are responsible
for an array of cellular processes. Interactions between various membrane
components, including lipid&#x02013;lipid, lipid&#x02013;protein, and
protein&#x02013;protein interactions, all contribute to the structure
and function of cell membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The study of membrane-bound
proteins is relevant to understanding many native cell processes as
well as the cytotoxic effects of some proteins, and much research
has been done to elucidate these details;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> however, mechanisms of membrane binding by proteins remain perplexing.
The difficulty of experimentally determining structural characteristics
of membrane-bound proteins and the small-scale interactions of peptides
with membranes makes molecular dynamics simulations a promising technique
for the study of membrane&#x02013;peptide interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, biological membranes have been found to have
significant and varied effects on protein structure. While inducing
or stabilizing an &#x003b1;-helical structure in some intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs), such as &#x003b1;-synuclein and islet amyloid
polypeptide (IAPP),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> near-membrane environments can also cause structural
loss of folded proteins; this loss of structure near membranes is
associated with the functionality of many proteins, including several
protein toxins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>One area of particular
interest in protein&#x02013;membrane interactions
is binding of proteins to membrane-bound cholesterol, which has led
to the definition of the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino
acid consensus (CRAC) motif.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Highly conserved
among cholesterol-interacting proteins, the CRAC motif takes the form
-L/V-X<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub>-Y-X<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub>-R/K-, where X<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub> may be any sequence of amino acids from one to five
residues in length. However, the liberal constraints of the CRAC algorithm
overpredict actual cholesterol-binding functionality. For example,
a leukotoxin (LtxA) produced by the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans</italic> exhibits binding specific to cholesterol
and contains two CRAC sequences, termed CRAC<sup>336</sup> (LEEYSKRFKK)
and CRAC<sup>503</sup> (VDYLKK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Of the
two CRAC sites, only CRAC<sup>336</sup> was shown to be responsible
for cholesterol binding of LtxA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Furthermore,
CRAC<sup>336</sup> is highly conserved among the repeats-in-toxin
family of proteins, which includes <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>&#x003b1;-hemolysin and <italic>Mannheimia hemolytica</italic> leukotoxin,
in addition to LtxA. The differences that exist between the two CRAC
regions that lead to their differing levels of functionality are unkown
but may provide insight into cholesterol binding not only by LtxA
but also by other toxins that conserve this functional CRAC region
and require cholesterol binding for toxicity.</p><p>We have performed
simulations of the peptides corresponding to
the CRAC<sup>336</sup> and CRAC<sup>503</sup> sequences (acetyl-FDRARMLEEYSKRFKKFGY-NH<sub>2</sub> and acetyl-QSGKAYVDYLKKGEELA-NH<sub>2</sub>, respectively) used in the experiments by Brown et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> By comparing simulations carried out both in
solution and near membrane bilayers, we are able to identify differences
in the interactions of the two peptides with a lipid bilayer in the
presence and absence of cholesterol. Consistent with former experiments,
CRAC<sup>336</sup>, but not CRAC<sup>503</sup>, showed strong membrane
affinity specific to the cholesterol-bearing bilayer. Additionally,
significant loss of the peptide&#x02019;s secondary structure was also
correlatively associated with its interaction with this membrane.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Computational
Methods</title><p>Simulation of each of the two peptides in solution

using Gromacs 4.5.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> with the Amber03d

box with 3.7 nm between the nearest faces, and ions were added to
neutralize charge. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> was performed using an NVT ensemble with 24
replicas from 300 to 499 K. Temperatures for each replica were 300,

409, 420, 431, 444, 455, 466, 477, 488, and 499 K. Electrostatic interactions
were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> with a real space cutoff of 0.9 nm. For van der Waals interactions,
a 1.2 nm cutoff was used. The simulation was initiated from a random-coil-like
conformation. Each replica was simulated for 151 ns, with a time step
of 2 fs, and exchange attempted every 1000 steps. The first 51 ns
were discarded as equilibration. Though frames that allowed the peptide
to interact with its periodic image were not significant (less than
4% of frames for CRAC<sup>503</sup> with a minimum distance between
periodic images of less than 0.6 nm), they were discarded from the
analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Both peptides were also simulated
near a pure DMPC bilayer composed
of 64 lipid molecules (32 in each leaflet) and a 40% cholesterol bilayer
composed of 128 molecules (26 cholesterol and 38 DMPC molecules in

with a real space cutoff of 1.0 nm. For van der Waals interactions,
a 1.0 nm cutoff was also used. Eight replicas were used to scale the
protein energy with effective temperatures of 300, 331.227, 365.704,
403.77, 445.798, 492.201, 543.434, and 600 K as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Each replica was simulated for 100 ns, with
a time step of 2 fs, and exchange attempted every 500 steps. Though
sufficient for the CRAC<sup>503</sup> peptide, eight replicas were
found to limit the exchange of the lowest-temperature replicas in
the case of the CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide. As a result, the final
configurations of this 100 ns run were used to populate 12 replicas
to scale the protein energy with effective temperatures of 300, 319.512,

100 ns, again with a time step of 2 fs, and exchange attempted every

from lowest to highest temperature nodes and is shown for the CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide with the 40% cholesterol membrane system in the <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>. Semi-isotropic pressure
coupling was maintained with the Parrinello&#x02013;Rahman barostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> using a coupling time of 5 ps. In each case,
the first 5 ns of the trajectory of interest (300 K) were discarded

averaging of secondary structure properties; these cumulative averages
of secondary structure propensities for the CRAC<sup>336</sup> DMPC

5 ns of equilibration time as described above. The CRAC<sup>336</sup> Y10A mutant required greater equilibration time and was simulated
for 150 ns, using the last 100 ns for analysis, and using 12 replicas.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results
and Discussion</title><p>Both CRAC<sup>336</sup> and CRAC<sup>503</sup> were simulated in
three environments: in solution, near a 1,2-dimyristoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) bilayer, and near a bilayer composed
of 60 mol % DMPC and 40 mol % cholesterol (DMPC/CHO). When comparing
LtxA binding to membranes with 0, 20, 40, and 60% cholesterol, Brown
et al. found that the protein had the greatest affinity for membranes
composed of 40% cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> In the same
study, it was found that LtxA&#x02019;s affinity for the 40% cholesterol
membrane was not attributable merely to its raft-like nature because
cholesterol binding of LtxA to a non-raft-like bilayer composed of
60 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC) and 40 mol % cholesterol (60:40 DOPC/CHO) was not significantly
different from its binding to the raft-like DMPC/CHO bilayer.</p><p>The extent to which each of the CRAC peptides interacted with the
membrane in our simulations varied between both the membrane environments
and the peptides. To compare each peptide&#x02019;s propensity to remain
close to or even penetrate the membrane surface, the time-averaged
density profile along the membrane normal for each case is plotted
in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Near the pure DMPC bilayer, both
CRAC<sup>336</sup> and CRAC<sup>503</sup> show sampling of space both
at the membrane interface and throughout the aqueous region. However,
the density profile of CRAC<sup>336</sup> near the 40% cholesterol
bilayer shows strong localization of the peptide close to the bilayer
surface. Though CRAC<sup>503</sup> shows some increase in near-membrane
density near the 40% cholesterol membrane, this peptide continues
to show significant sampling of space throughout the aqueous region
as well.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Density profiles of each CRAC peptide/membrane system along the

of
the two peptides are responsible for their cholesterol interaction,
secondary structure assignments were determined for each 300 K solution
trajectory using the DSSP algorithm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Averaging
the number of residues assigned to each secondary structure over the
trajectory yields similar results for the two peptides, with both
sharing comparable tendencies toward each secondary structure assignment
(Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, black). Secondary structure assignments
per residue are plotted in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, again
showing similar results for both peptides in solution. Both peptides
share an overall high coil, low-to-moderate &#x003b2;-sheet propensity
as well as a helical propensity over their central residues. CRAC<sup>336</sup> does show greater &#x003b2;-sheet and lower &#x003b1;-helix
propensity than CRAC<sup>503</sup>, and it is possible that these
structural differences may contribute to the cholesterol-binding activity
of the peptides. However, greater structural differences are seen
in the near-membrane environments.</p><p>To determine whether membrane
interactions induce structural changes
in either of the two CRAC peptides, DSSP secondary structure assignments
were determined for the ensemble of each peptide near both the DMPC/CHO
and the pure DMPC bilayers (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, red and
green, respectively). Despite a quantitative change in &#x003b2;-sheet
propensity, the qualitative structural characteristics of CRAC<sup>503</sup> near both bilayers remain similar to those in aqueous solution,
which could be expected based on the relatively weak interaction between
the peptide and the bilayers. In the secondary structure of all three
environments, the average number of residues shows some &#x003b2;-sheet
propensity in addition to a more considerable helical propensity.
However, we observe significant changes in secondary structure of
CRAC<sup>336</sup> near the 40% cholesterol membrane compared to its
secondary structure in solution. Near the cholesterol-bearing membrane,
the average number of total residues in &#x003b1;- and 3<sub>10</sub>-helical structures and in summed &#x003b2;-sheet and &#x003b2;-bridge
structures drops to less than 20 and 10%, respectively, of their original
values in solution. The secondary structure of this peptide per residue
reveals diminished helicity and &#x003b2;-sheet propensity in favor
of increased coil conformation across the entire sequence. This effect
is not attributable merely to the presence of a membrane because CRAC<sup>336</sup> maintains both helical and &#x003b2;-sheet structures near
the pure DMPC membrane. In contrast to this marked difference in secondary
structure propensities near the cholesterol-bearing membrane, CRAC<sup>336</sup> and CRAC<sup>503</sup> share similar structural characteristics
near the pure DMPC membrane. These results provide a striking example
of the functionality of disorder. Of the two CRAC peptides in both
bilayer environments, only CRAC<sup>336</sup> near the 40% cholesterol
membrane shows a strong singular affinity for the peptide to remain
close to the bilayer interface, and the cholesterol-binding functionality
of this peptide is coupled to its secondary structure loss.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Secondary structure

a CRAC motif (-L/V-X<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub>-Y-X<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub>-R/K-), the sole residue that is always required
is the central tyrosine, and CRAC<sup>336</sup> near the 40% cholesterol
bilayer shows insertion of this residue at the membrane interface
during our equilibrium trajectory. Initial interactions between the
CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide and the 40% cholesterol bilayer show insertion
of not only this central Tyr but also a C-terminal Tyr at the bilayer
interface. Near-membrane structures of the CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide
near the pure DMPC bilayer frequently display insertion of the N-terminal
Phe or C-terminal Tyr; there is no preference for interaction between
the central Tyr residue and the membrane (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To explore the role of both tyrosine residues in the interation
of CRAC<sup>336</sup> with the 40% cholesterol membrane, two tyrosine-to-alanine
single point mutants, CRAC<sup>336</sup> Y10A and CRAC<sup>336</sup> Y19A, were also simulated near the 40% cholesterol membrane. The
Y10A and Y19A mutants have an average of 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.7 and 3.8 &#x000b1;
0.6 residues, respectively, in the summed helical secondary structure
versus an average of 0.22 &#x000b1; 0.09 for the wild-type (WT) CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide, indicating that unlike the WT peptide, neither
mutant loses its &#x003b1;-helical propensity near the 40% cholesterol
bilayer. Furthermore, density profiles of each system show that the
CRAC<sup>336</sup> single point mutants sample structures both near
the membrane and in the aqueous solution region (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>Together with the observed interactions between the
central Tyr
and the cholesterol-bearing membrane and between the terminal Tyr
and the pure DMPC membrane, the results of the Y10A and Y19A mutation
simulations described above suggest that the central Tyr of the CRAC
motif plays a significant role in cholesterol binding. However, the
terminal Tyr of CRAC<sup>336</sup> may function in stabilizing near-membrane
structures, thereby allowing the central Tyr to interact with the
membrane. Additionally, the lack of interaction between the central
Tyr and the pure DMPC membrane further suggests that the characteristic
interaction of the peptide near the 40% cholesterol membrane is cholesterol-specific.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Snapshots

molecular dynamics
simulations to compare the effects of lipid bilayer environment on
two peptides. Consistent with a previous experimental study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> our results show a decided preference for the
membrane only in the case of CRAC<sup>336</sup> near a 40% cholesterol,
60% DMPC bilayer. This preference is not seen for the same peptide
near a pure DMPC bilayer or for CRAC<sup>503</sup> near either bilayer.
Furthermore, our work adds to ongoing experimental work in two key
ways: by identifying the role of disorder in cholesterol interactions
and by examining the role of the central Tyr in the CRAC motif. As
the CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide moves from solution to interact with
the 40% cholesterol bilayer, the peptide loses its helical propensity
and adopts a random coil conformation. The significance of disorder
in protein behavior is becoming more clear; numerous studies have
contributed examples of proteins that are disordered in their bound
state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Our work here highlights the role
of disorder in protein&#x02013;membrane interactions. A single point
mutation of the central Tyr, converting it to Ala, resulted in loss
of the characteristic behavior of CRAC<sup>336</sup> near the 40%
cholesterol bilayer, and though the central Tyr of the WT CRAC<sup>336</sup> peptide interacts significantly with the cholesterol-bearing
bilayer, the same residue does not show the same high propensity for
interaction with the cholesterol-devoid bilayer. Furthermore, the
