There are more than 90 known plant rhabdoviruses, most of which are transmitted by hemipteran insects, including aphids (Aphididae), planthoppers (Delphacidae), and leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Plant rhabdoviruses are transmitted in a persistent propagative manner, replicating in and migrating through the insect across several molecular and physical barriers prior to being transmitted to a new plant host <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Following virus acquisition and before the vector becomes inoculative, there is a latency period of a few days to weeks, during which the virus replicates in the vector <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113529-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The movement and replication of rhabdoviruses in their insect hosts requires specific interactions between virus and vector components to overcome the major transmission barriers, which usually results in a high degree of vector specificity.</p><p>Differences in rhabdovirus transmission efficiency have been reported among races/biotypes within the same vector species, and also among virus strains transmitted by the same insect vector <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Sylvester1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. <italic>Graminella nigrifrons</italic> is a common leafhopper on wheat, maize, and other grasses in the eastern U.S <xref rid="pone.0113529-Stoner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is the only known vector of <italic>Maize fine streak virus</italic> (MFSV; family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Nucleorhabdovirus</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0113529-Redinbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, within a laboratory population, only a small percentage of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> exposed to MFSV were capable of transmitting the virus <xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the remainder of the population, some individuals were hosts of but did not transmit MFSV, and others were not virus hosts. These groups of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> were categorized as &#x02018;transmitters&#x02019;, which acquired and transmitted virus (i.e., they are vectors); &#x02018;acquirers&#x02019;, which acquired but did not transmit MFSV; and, &#x02018;non-acquirers&#x02019;, which did not retain virus after feeding on maize infected with MFSV <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The underlying mechanisms that determine the transmission efficacy of MFSV and other rhabdoviruses are not well understood.</p><p>Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors are thought to influence the capability of insects to acquire, maintain, and transmit pathogens <xref rid="pone.0113529-Hogenhout1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Nault1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, traits that have a genetic component are of the greatest significance&#x02014;a discordant genetic interaction will not result in competent vectors even if the environment is suitable <xref rid="pone.0113529-Power1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is thought that genetic elements in both the vector and virus and their interactions determine whether an individual insect within a species is capable of vectoring a particular virus strain <xref rid="pone.0113529-Gray2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Assessment of pathogen-induced transcriptional changes in insect vectors has been key for identifying genes contributing to pathogen host responses, and providing insights into the molecular and cellular processes important for pathogen infection and transmission <xref rid="pone.0113529-Baton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Currently, investigations into the regulatory control of insect immune systems are most advanced for <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> but data are becoming increasingly available for plant-infecting vectors <xref rid="pone.0113529-Luan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

However, in these experiments, transcript abundance was characterized without regard to the transmission competence of individual leafhoppers. While leafhopper populations composed only of transmitters, acquirers, or non-acquirers have yet to be selected, a combination of laboratory and greenhouse assays has been developed to distinguish individuals based on their transmission group <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We hypothesized that the differences in MFSV transmission capability among individual leafhoppers have a significant genetic component (e.g., regulatory or sequence divergence).</p><p>The sequencing and assembly of the MFSV genome <xref rid="pone.0113529-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transcriptome <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> provide valuable tools for exploring the transcriptional basis of vector competence. We hypothesized that transcript expression and sequence variation in the vector and virus contribute to MFSV infection of and transmission by <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic>, and used RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR approaches to examine differences among <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transmission groups and MFSV.

In animal rhabdoviruses, the expression of structural genes is primarily regulated by gene order, with decreasing levels of viral transcripts for genes from the 3&#x02032; end to 5&#x02032; end of the genome <xref rid="pone.0113529-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.

These results indicate that MFSV gene transcription is not attenuated across the viral genome in the infected insect host, and suggests that the virus uses a different means to regulate transcript expression.</p><fig id="pone-0113529-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113529.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>MFSV transcript accumulation in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transmitters and acquirers.</title><p>Accumulation of MFSV transcripts relative to the N gene was determined using RT-qPCR.

No fixed nucleotide differences were identified between acquirers and transmitters. The MFSV reference genome sequence was determined from MFSV isolated from infected plant tissue, and may reflect a viral genome sequence that is not capable of infecting in leafhoppers, and the identified SNP may be advantageous for MFSV infection of leafhoppers.

In this study, we used RNA-Seq to explore genetic changes in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> and MFSV that may be associated with the ability of the insect vector to acquire and transmit the virus. The consistency in MFSV transmission rates across replicates and studies provides evidence that intraspecific transmission capacity is a least partially genetically determined. Non-acquirers were distinguished from acquirers and transmitters, with substantial differences in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization and immunity genes. Genetic differences between acquirers and transmitters were more limited, which may be due to inherent difficulties discriminating between the two groups and/or the likelihood that the transmitter phenotype results from one or a few genetic differences. The competence of infected leafhoppers to transmit MFSV does not appear associated with virus transcript abundance in leafhoppers or sequence polymorphisms in the viral genome. However, the non-structural MFSV 3 gene was expressed at unexpectedly high levels in infected leafhoppers, suggesting it plays an active role in the infection of the insect host. Further studies are needed to identify factors that potentially confound our phenotype-driven transmission categories and influence the genetic analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information Legends</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113529.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>The primer pair sequences for targeted <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> mRNAs designed using Primer3.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0113529.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113529.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>The 891 G. nigrifrons transcripts that had significantly different transcript accumulation among transmission groups.
