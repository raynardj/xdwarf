We found AKR1C3, an aldo-keto reductase expressed seldom in most human tissues, expressed higher in radioresistance-acquired cells. Suppression of AKR1C3 via RNAi or its chemical inhibitors restored the sensitivity of the acquired tumor cells and xenograft BALB/c nude mice to ionizing radiation (IR). Cellular monitoring of the oxidative stress in the AKR1C3-elevated cells indicated that IR-induced ROS accumulation and the concomitant DNA damage was significantly alleviated, and such protective consequence disappeared upon AKR1C3 knockdown. These findings uncover the potential involvement of AKR1C3 in removal of cellular ROS and explain, at least partially, the acquired radioresistance by AKR1C3 overexpression. A retrospective analysis of esophageal carcinomas also indicated a significant expression of AKR1C3 in radio-resistant but not radio-sensitive surgical samples. Our study may provide a potential biomarker for predicting prognosis of radiotherapy and even direct a targeted therapy for esophageal cancer and other tumors.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2010CB12300 for DM Zhou), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91029711, 20932001 and 20852001) and Funding from the Education Ministry (20110001110054).

Such therapeutic intervention usually relies on the interaction between IR and water molecules in cells that produces excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thus places cancer cells under extensive oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0111911-Riley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The highly unstable ROS react with DNA and other macromolecules in the vicinity, producing gene defect, chromosome aberration and other damage <xref rid="pone.0111911-Majima1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Mitochondria damage by IR can even lead to prolonged oxidative stress and thus further damages DNA and other cellular molecules <xref rid="pone.0111911-Spitz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Accumulation of DNA damage is an important factor in triggering IR-induced failure of cell division and proliferation that leads to cell apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0111911-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Despite of the therapeutic significance, IR resistance is a major impediment to cancer therapy <xref rid="pone.0111911-Vonessen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It has been reported that repairing of IR-induced DNA damage, either double strand breaks or single strand defects, is one important mechanism underlying cancer recurrence and radioresistance <xref rid="pone.0111911-Guryanova1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111911-Huen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Removal of IR-generated ROS by antioxidant enzymes constitutes alternative mechanism leading to radioresistance. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), peroxiredoxin (TPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the largest class of antioxidant enzymes, have such ability to diminish IR-induced ROS accumulation <xref rid="pone.0111911-Sablina1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111911-Nogueira1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Certain cancer cells and cancer stem cells contain a higher expression of antioxidant enzymes and are thus preferentially spared from irradiation <xref rid="pone.0111911-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111911-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Discovery of other cellular enzymes involved in counteracting oxidative stress may be helpful for diagnosis of non-susceptible patients to radiotherapy and even direct an effective targeted therapy for malignant tumors.</p><p>Esophageal cancer is a common cancer with a 5-year survival rate of 5&#x02013;19% <xref rid="pone.0111911-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. There is strong evidence suggesting that radioresistance of esophageal cancer might be congenital, <italic>i.e.</italic> related to gender and ethnicity, or be induced by lifestyle such as smoking <xref rid="pone.0111911-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, esophageal carcinoma may provide an ideal model for identification of cellular factors by which radioresistance is induced. In this study, we found that the acquiring of radioresistance coincided with elevated expression of AKR1C3 in esophageal cancer cells, and suppression of AKR1C3 expression restored the sensitivity of the acquired tumor cells and xenograft animals to ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, cellular monitoring of the oxidative stress in the AKR1C3-elevated cells indicated that ROS accumulation and the concomitant DNA damage was significantly alleviated, and such protective consequence disappeared upon AKR1C3 knockdown. A retrospective analysis indicated a significant AKR1C3 expression in radio-resistant but non-resistant surgical esophageal carcinomas. Our findings may provide a new biomarker for prediction of non-susceptible patients to radiotherapy and even direct a targeted therapy for esophageal cancer and other tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and irradiation</title><p>KY170 and TE13, two human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines, and their derived radioresistant cell lines KY170R and TE13R were provided as a gift by Department of Radiology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, USA.

To examine this issue, the expression levels of AKR1C3 in KY170R and TE13R were down-regulated by shRNAs delivered by lentivector pSD31 and the effects of AKR1C3 knockdown on radioresistance were characterized. To exclude off-target issues, three shRNAs were utilized in parallel to elucidate the impact of RNAi on KY170R cells with a scramble shRNA as a negative control.

Characterization of AKR1C3 knockdown on cell proliferation indicated that KY170R-shRNA1, KY170R-shRNA2 and KY170R-shRNA3 (three stable cell lines generated by pSD31-mediated transduction) proliferated at almost the same rate as KY170R-scramble cell, which itself had a rate almost identical to that seen in KY170R and KY170 cells (<bold>Fig. S1A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111911.s001">File S1</xref></bold>).

MJ is a well-established small molecule with its structure resembling to prostaglandins, the substrate of aldo-keto reductases, and thus acts as a competitive inhibitor of AKR1C3.

These observations correlate surprisingly well with clinical observations: SCLC is always highly radiosensitive and radiotherapy can significantly enhance survival of SCLC patients <xref rid="pone.0111911-Pignon1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In addition, breast cancer patients with higher levels of expression of AKR1C3 had a worse overall prognosis <xref rid="pone.0111911-Oduwole1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> after irradiation and a higher rate of late recurrence <xref rid="pone.0111911-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These clinical observations suggest that elevated levels of expression of AKR1C3 lead to radioresistance in tumors other than esophageal cancer. It also suggests that a combination of IR and suppression of AKR1C3 represent an effective way to eradicate malignant tumors.</p><p>Collectively, we explored the non-radioresistant vs. resistant esophageal cancer cells and found the coincidence of differentiation of AKR1C3 expression, cellular ROS level/DNA damage and acquired radioresistance. AKR1C3 acts as a switch controlling the response of tumor cells and the derived xenografts to IR. Cellular monitoring of the oxidative stress in the AKR1C3-elevated cells indicated that IR-induced ROS accumulation and the concomitant DNA damage was significantly alleviated, and such protective consequence disappeared upon AKR1C3 knockdown. A retrospective analysis of esophageal carcinomas also indicated the significant trend that a higher expression of AKR1C3 was detected in radio-resistant but not radio-sensitive surgical samples. Our study suggests that AKR1C3 might share the same properties as antioxidant enzymes in alleviation of ROS accumulation in tumor cells and may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting prognosis of radiotherapy and even direct a targeted therapy for esophageal cancer and other tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111911.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
