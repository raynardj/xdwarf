The current management is to discharge patients as early as possible so they can get back to their daily activities. Once discharged, there are three main issues relating to morbidity, mortality, and risk of a subsequent fracture that need to be addressed and discussed. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate the evidence from published literature, to determine the outcome of osteoporotic fracture patients after their hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The MEDLINE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases were searched, using the terms &#x0201c;osteoporosis&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;fracture&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;osteoporotic fracture&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hip fracture&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;vertebral fracture&#x0201d;. We included only human studies published in English between 2004 and 2014. The reference lists of included studies were thoroughly reviewed in search for other relevant studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 18 studies met the selection criteria. Most were observational and cohort studies. Out of all the studies, five studies looked into the morbidity, six studies looked into the risk of subsequent fractures, and seven studies looked into mortality. Vertebral fracture caused the greatest health burden, but hip fracture patients were the main users of informal care after hospital discharge. There was an increased risk of a subsequent fracture after a primary fracture compared with the control group, a cohort comparison, or the general population. Osteoporotic fractures, especially hip fractures, are associated with higher mortality rate despite the advances in the management of osteoporotic fracture cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is strong evidence to show that after hospital discharge, osteoporotic fracture patients are faced with higher morbidity, subsequent fractures, and mortality.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>hip fracture</kwd><kwd>vertebral fracture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is defined as deterioration in bone mass and architecture resulting in weakness of the bone, which is then prone to fracture. The major complication is osteoporotic fracture, which occurs with minimal trauma, such as a simple fall from standing height or less. Osteoporotic fracture is also known as low-trauma, nontraumatic, or fragility fracture. Fractures in elderly have caused significant impact on the community health.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Approximately 50% of women and 22% of men over the age of 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime.<xref rid="b2-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The high incidence of fractures in the elderly aged 50 years and above may be contributed by weakness of the bone due to osteoporosis.<xref rid="b4-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The incidence of osteoporosis is on the rise due to the aging society. People are living longer with better health services, but their bone mineral density is likely to deteriorate with aging or other secondary causes, thus increasing the risk of osteoporotic fractures. The main osteoporotic fracture sites are hip, spine, and wrist, while other less common sites are forearm, ribs, and pelvis. Following an osteoporotic fracture, the patient is exposed to several adverse outcomes, which can be divided into three broad categories: morbidity, risk of subsequent fracture, and mortality.</p><p>Morbidity is defined as the state of being diseased or unhealthy within a population. Osteoporotic fracture is associated with significant morbidity, which may adversely affect the patient&#x02019;s socioeconomic, physical, and psychological well-being. The negative implications of the patient&#x02019;s morbid condition may also encroach into their caretaker&#x02019;s life. This is more likely to happen with the current practice of early hospital discharge into the care of family or relative, to reduce hospitalization cost, reduce the risk of nosocomial infections, and promote recovery in their home environment. Therefore, research is necessary to develop a better understanding of the impact of osteoporotic fracture on health burden and decline of function after patients are discharged to their home.<xref rid="b6-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Of all the osteoporotic fractures, hip fracture has been given the most attention. There are many reports on the personal burden of hip fracture, especially in terms of limited mobility.<xref rid="b7-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> One study found that about 50% of elderly women with hip fracture lost the ability to walk independently.<xref rid="b9-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Similarly, another found that about 50% of women with hip fracture lost their independence and required long-term care or help in carrying out their daily activities.<xref rid="b10-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In another study, up to one-third of hip fracture patients became totally dependent on their family members and relatives.<xref rid="b11-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The burden due to hip fracture was frequently reported, although it represented less than half of all fractures in elderly over 80 years old.<xref rid="b7-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The incidence of vertebral fractures is 1.4 million cases worldwide, which affects 25% of postmenopausal women and 40% of women aged 80 years and older.<xref rid="b12-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The risk of sustaining a vertebral fracture is higher in women, with 15.4% lifetime risk for women and 8.6% for men older than 45 years old.<xref rid="b14-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The prevalence of vertebral fractures increases with age for both sexes.<xref rid="b15-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> As compared with hip fracture, there are limited reports on vertebral fractures, which may result in underestimation of the burden that they impose.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The major burden faced by patients with vertebral fracture is back pain, which may last for a few weeks to months or longer.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> They may also experience functional difficulties, kyphosis, and height loss. The interference of the patient&#x02019;s daily activities due to vertebral fracture was found to be comparable with that of hip fractures.<xref rid="b19-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>It was found that just as in hip and vertebral fractures, wrist fractures may, to some degree, interfere with the ability to perform daily activities, such as cleaning up and cooking. In isolated cases, patients are completely disabled by a wrist fracture.<xref rid="b20-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> About half of the wrist fracture patients reported only fair or poor functional outcomes at 6 months postfracture.<xref rid="b21-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The impact of osteoporotic fracture is not restricted to physical burden and may also result in psychological consequences. However, there are very few studies on the psychological impact of fracture on the patient. The patients may suffer low self-esteem, impaired body image and mood changes.<xref rid="b22-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Osteoporosis fracture recovery may take time and incur significant burden in health costs.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The management of osteoporotic fractures places significant burden to formal health care, such as hospitalizations, rehabilitative and long-term care, and informal care.<xref rid="b24-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> According to the current fracture management protocol, patients are discharged from the hospital earlier to reduce costs and risks of nosocomial infections from lengthy hospital stay. This shifts the fracture management and costs to rehabilitation in the community.</p><p>It was reported that hospitalizations for fractures, particularly hip fractures, represent only a portion of the burden of fractures.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Wiktorowicz et al<xref rid="b27-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reported that the cost of initial hospitalization of hip fracture cases may represent only 27% of total costs of management, while the costs of managing this patient after discharge from the hospital may account for 69% of 1-year costs postfracture. The main cost of rehabilitation for hip fracture was estimated to be 59% of all costs and was mainly spent for stays at nursing homes and rehabilitation centers, as well as outpatient and home physical therapy sessions.<xref rid="b28-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, merely focusing on the costs of acute care of fractures could underestimate the financial burden related to fractures.</p><p>Osteoporotic patients have higher risk for subsequent fractures, which are associated with an even greater increase in mortality rates and a significantly higher cost.<xref rid="b29-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Despite substantial evidence that a prior fracture resulted in an increased risk of subsequent fracture, less than 30% of postmenopausal women and less than 10% of men with prior fracture receive prophylactic treatment.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b30-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Mortality is the term used for the number of people who died within a population. In addition to compromising the quality of life, fractures are associated with increased mortality.<xref rid="b32-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> For the past decade, the trend for hip fracture management has shifted toward surgical approach, with more and more patients ending up by receiving a hemiprosthesis. With the significant advancement in management of patients with hip fracture, there is a need to review more recent studies to analyze the impact of osteoporotic fractures on mortality rate of its sufferers.</p><p>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the outcome of osteoporotic fracture patients after their hospital discharge. Most studies have focused on various aspects of osteoporotic fracture cases while they were managed in the hospital. This review concentrates on the patient outcomes of osteoporotic fracture after they were discharged from the hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Search strategy</title><p>For a comprehensive search of health science journals, we used MEDLINE, via Ovid MEDLINE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), via EBSCOhost.

The risk of hospitalization was higher if the vertebral fracture had occurred less than 10 years previously. Therefore, compared with other types of osteoporotic fractures, vertebral fracture resulted in higher risk of hospitalization and longer hospital stay. In terms of destination after discharge from hospitals, 87% of patients with vertebral fracture were discharged to home. Only 55% of patients with a hip fracture were discharged to home, while 36% were transferred or discharged to a nursing home.

Hip fracture patients had greater tendency to use rehabilitative and home care services, with almost 70% reporting use of rehabilitative services. In comparison, only 25% of the vertebral fracture patients used the rehabilitative services.</p><p>In term of home care services, which included nurse home visits or homemaker services, about 50% of the hip fracture patients had used these services. In contrast, only about 15% of the vertebral fracture patients had used the services.</p><p>It was calculated that nearly 76% of the hip fracture patients had used either the rehabilitative services or the home care services, while only about 30% of the vertebral fracture patients had used either service. As for patients of other types of osteoporotic fracture, about 35% had used the rehabilitative services, 14.3% the home care services, and 37.4% had used either service.</p><p>The longer hospital stay and rehabilitative services for fracture patients require extra costs. In a study on the rehabilitation costs after nonvertebral fractures, involving five European countries, the highest costs were observed for hip fractures, followed by fractures of the leg (tibia, fibula, and femur but not hip) and the humerus.

Most of the studies on mortality related to osteoporotic fractures have focused on hip fractures as the numbers of elderly people with fractured neck of the femur are increasing in the world population. Despite the extra attention given and the advancement in patient management, the case fatality rates after fractured neck of femur have not declined appreciably.<xref rid="b44-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>Vestergaard et al<xref rid="b45-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> analyzed registries for patients suffering hip fractures from 1981 to 2001. They found the relative 1-year survival in patients with hip fracture was lower than in control cases. There was a significant higher mortality in women with hip fractures from 1986 to 1996. A similar but less pronounced trend was observed in male patients. There was greater mortality, at all time periods, in patients with hip fractures than in controls. The excess mortality continued to increase, with the HR jumping from 1.80 (years 1981&#x02013;1985) to 3.84 (years 1996&#x02013;2001). In term of sex difference, the mortality risk was higher in men than in women.</p><p>Bliuc et al<xref rid="b46-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> classified low-trauma fractures into vertebral, hip, and minor and major fractures, and studied their mortality rate in the population of Dubbo, Australia. Age-adjusted standardized mortality ratios were increased following all low-trauma fractures in both sexes. Mortality was increased for all ages and for all fractures, except for minor fractures, which was only apparent for those older than 75 years. Increased mortality risk persisted for 5 years for all fractures and for up to 10 years for hip fractures. Subsequent fracture was associated with an increased mortality HR. The mortality risk increased following a subsequent fracture then declined but remained higher than in the general population. A more detailed follow up on a group of participants revealed that the predictors of mortality after any fragility fracture for both sexes were found to be age, quadriceps weakness, and subsequent fracture. Low bone mineral density, smoking, and postural sway were also predictors for women, while low physical activity was another predictor for men. Comorbidities were not a predictor of mortality.</p><p>Brauer et al<xref rid="b47-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> documented hip fracture cases from the Medicare claims from 1985 to 2005. The age and risk-adjusted mortality in women were found to decline by 11.9%, 14.9%, and 8.8% for 30-, 180-, and 360-day mortality, respectively. For men, the age and risk-adjusted mortality were found to decrease by 21.8%, 25.4%, and 20.0% for 30-, 180-, and 360-day mortality, respectively.</p><p>Soderqvist et al<xref rid="b48-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> reported that mortality rate at 4 and 24 months after a hip fracture were 16% and 38%, respectively. The mortality rate was associated with high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, low Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score, being elderly, and male sex.</p><p>Ziad&#x000e9; et al<xref rid="b49-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> analyzed French death certificates from 1968 to 2004 and found that 2.2% of the reported deaths were due to osteoporotic fractures. About 1.5% of death or 69% of all osteoporotic fractures were identified as hip fracture cases. Hip fractures were the most frequent cause of death, followed by pelvis, vertebra, skull, ribs, and multiple fractures. Throughout the years, the mortality rates for hip fracture were higher in women than in men, but the gap in the rates between the sexes was narrowed by 2004.</p><p>Panula et al<xref rid="b50-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> followed up patients after hip fracture surgeries and reported that 79% died within 7 years. The main cause of death was circulatory system disease, which accounted for 44.1% of deaths. Most of the participants (75%) died at the hospital, health center, or other care facility. About 25% died outside the hospital, either at home, elderly care facility, or even at an unknown place for one of the patients.</p><p>Kanis et al<xref rid="b51-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> reported that the mortality risk was markedly increased immediately after fracture at all ages. The risk increased with age at a rate that was higher than that of the general population and comparable with the mortality risk 1 year after hip fracture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Vertebral fracture patients faced greater health burden after their hospital discharge than did those with other types of osteoporotic fracture. The fracture was associated with higher comorbidity, higher incidence of hospitalization, and longer hospital stay. These complications were especially evident in elderly men, with risks of pneumonia and musculoskeletal diseases.<xref rid="b35-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Focusing on sex, women with vertebral fractures had poorer functional capabilities compared with women without fracture or fracture at nonosteoporotic sites. Men with vertebral fracture performed poorly in quadriceps strength and Timed Up and Go test compared with men without fracture. They also scored poorly in activity of daily living questionnaires compared with men without fracture or fracture at nonosteoporotic sites.<xref rid="b35-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Vertebral fracture was associated with poorer outcome compared with other fractures, including hip fracture.<xref rid="b35-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Therefore, vertebral fracture patients were expected to be the main users of rehabilitative and home care services after their discharge from the hospitals; on the contrary, the main users of these services were found to be hip fracture patients, instead of vertebral fracture patients.<xref rid="b34-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This may be due to the fact that 88% of the hip fracture patients underwent surgery for internal or external fixation or joint replacement, thus increasing their requirements for rehabilitative and home care services after their discharge form the hospital.<xref rid="b34-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Furthermore, the main symptom of vertebral fracture, which is back pain, may vary in its intensity and may not be apparent. Sudden severe back pain may indicate vertebral fracture and should be taken seriously. However, the pain may be relatively mild or unnoticeable in some patients, thus reducing the need to use the rehabilitative and home care services after their hospital discharge.</p><p>Patients with multiple fractures were more likely to make use of the rehabilitative and home care services compared with single-fracture patients, after their discharge from the hospital. Therefore health care providers will have to be aware of the needs of multiple-fracture patients and the extra costs required in managing them. The relevant authorities also need to plan and implement strategies to prevent multiple-fracture cases.</p><p>Family members or friends may provide &#x0201c;informal&#x0201d; care while fracture patients are in the hospital or after their discharge. The informal care in hospital was minimal and limited to helping the patient to drink, stand up, get into bed, and sit.<xref rid="b52-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Extensive informal care may not be appropriate as the majority of the nursing staffs disagreed with informal in-hospital care for certain chores, such as making the patient&#x02019;s bed, changing sheets, and performing bed baths.<xref rid="b53-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>The current fracture management includes early discharge of the patient to home. The median length of stay for hip fracture decreased from 12 days in the years 1986&#x02013;1988 to 5 days in the years 2003&#x02013;2005.<xref rid="b47-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> This has highlighted the importance of informal care for fracture patients after their discharge from the hospital. Although informal care provides valuable substitute and complement for costly formal care, there are limited studies available on this form of patient care.<xref rid="b54-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b55-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The care provided by informal caretakers may be done voluntarily at no charge, but there are still costs involved. The caregivers may have to take unpaid leave or forego earnings just to take care of the patient.<xref rid="b56-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="b57-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Kaffashian et al<xref rid="b34-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> reported that 36% of the caregivers had a paying job and that 25% had to take at least 1 day off to care for their relative with fracture. Thus, to get a complete and accurate understanding of the burden of fractures, studies must take into account the costs related to postacute and informal care used after the hospital discharge.<xref rid="b58-tcrm-10-937" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p><p>Osteoporotic fracture is a recognized complication of osteoporosis. If another osteoporosis-related fracture occurs within a short period of time, it may result in prolonged hospitalization and considerable economic, physical, and psychological burden on society.

Patients aged 60 years or older with primary distal radius fracture had higher incidence of subsequent hip fracture.
