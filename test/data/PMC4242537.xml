However, its potential significance of nucleoplasmic localizations remains greatly elusive. Here we demonstrate that PML interacts with LC3 in a cell type-independent manner as assessed by Co-IP assay and co-localization observation. Overexpressed PML significantly coprecipitates with endogenous and nuclear LC3 protein. Furthermore, a fraction of endogenous PML protein is found to be co-localized with LC3 protein under steady state condition, which is further enhanced by IFN&#x003b1; induction, indicating that PML up-regulation potentiates this interaction. Additionally, DsRed-PML associates with EGFP-LC3 during telophase and G1 phase but not in metaphase and anaphase. Two potential LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs in PML are required for interaction of PML with LC3 while this association is independent of autophagic activity. Finally, we show that interaction between PML and LC3 contributes to cell growth inhibition function of PML. Considering that PML is an important tumor suppressor, we propose that nuclear portion of LC3 protein may associate with PML to control cell growth for prevention and inhibition of cancer occurrence and development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (81372191; 81270620 from HY).

PML protein is characterized by presence of RBCC or tripartite motif (TRIM), which consists of a C3HC4 zinc-finger motif (RING finger), two cysteine-rich and zinc-binding regions (B-boxes), followed by leucine coiled-coil region <xref rid="pone.0113089-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Primary and single PML gene transcript undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in expression of seven isoforms designated PML I to PML VIIb. They share the same N-terminal region containing RBCC/TRIM but differ in their C-terminal sequences. Although each PML isoform displays its specific functions, PML proteins generally function as an organizer to PML nuclear bodies (NBs) or PODs (for PML oncogenic domains), which are dynamic and speckled nuclear structures harboring numerous proteins transiently or covalently associated <xref rid="pone.0113089-Batty1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, PML and PML NBs are implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation, protein storage, posttranslational modification, DNA damage response, apoptosis, senescence, angiogenesis, metabolism, antiviral defense and tumor suppression <xref rid="pone.0113089-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Salomoni1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Nakahara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Multicellular animal Atg8 proteins comprise three subfamilies: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3 or LC3), &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) and Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16) <xref rid="pone.0113089-Kabeya1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Among these molecules, LC3B (hereafter referred to LC3) is the first identified mammalian Atg8 protein and regarded as an important marker for assessing autophagic activity so far. During autophagy, cleaved form of LC3 (LC3-I) by Atg4 cysteine proteases is converted into phosphotidylethanolamine (PE) conjugated form (LC3-II), and subsequently LC3-II binds to outer and inner membranes of autophagosomes, thus directly participating in phagophore elongation and autophagosome formation <xref rid="pone.0113089-Nakatogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recently, accumulating lines of evidence suggest that LC3 acts as a modifier to associate with cargo receptors that sequester cargo into autophagosomes, and promotes selective autophagy through LC3 interacting region (LIR) motif in these receptor proteins <xref rid="pone.0113089-Birgisdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Rogov1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Interaction of PML and LC3 persists in Atg5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g005">Figure 5a</xref>), which have only LC3-I due to an autophagy defect that prevents processing of LC3-I to LC3-II. Co-IP data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g001">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g006">Figure 6b</xref> indicate a preferential interaction of PML with LC3-I. Therefore, we speculate that PML may interact with both LC3-I and -II forms. Actually, interaction of PML and LC3 is not dependent on autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g005">Figure 5</xref>). More importantly, a fraction of endogenous PML protein was found to be colocalized with LC3 protein, while this colocalization effect was further potentiated by IFN&#x003b1; induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g003">Figure 3</xref>), supporting that PML interacts with nuclear portion of LC3 protein under physiological conditions and this interaction effect can be potentiated by PML upregulation. Recently, several reports indicate that LC3 has a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution and the mobility of EGFP-LC3 protein in nucleus and cytoplasm was substantially slower as analyzed by FRAP suggesting that LC3 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm areas <xref rid="pone.0113089-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. LC3 contains a putative nuclear export signal but it has not a known nuclear localization signal (NLS). Therefore, its nuclear import could be mediated through an interaction with a protein containing an NLS. PML could possibly be this candidate protein. Further, we found that PML associates with LC3 during telophase and G1 phase but not in metaphase and anaphase, suggesting their interaction specifically occurred in some phases of cell cycle. This phenomenon and its potential significance deserved to be further addressed.</p><p>Substantial evidence suggests that LIR motif is essential for proteins interacting with LC3 or its related family proteins. Our results showed that two conserved LIR motifs and particular the second one in PML sequence are required for interaction of PML with LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g006">Figure 6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113089-g007">7</xref>), suggesting that PML may directly interact with LC3. We cannot exclude the possibility that other LC3-interacting proteins may contribute to this observed phenotype. In particularly, p62 (sequestosome 1) and phosphoinositide-binding protein ALFY, described as binding partners for LC3 directly or indirectly, have been recently found to colocalize in PML NBs when nuclear export is blocked by treatment of exportin-1 inhibitor leptomycin B <xref rid="pone.0113089-Clausen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Moreover, another possibility that other proteins localized in PML nuclear bodies may also contribute to this interacting effect needs to be elucidated in future. Identifying PML-interacting proteins may address this issue.</p><p>LIR-containing proteins include cargo receptors such as p62, the related neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1) and optineurin, members of the basal autophagy machinery, proteins associated with vehicles and their transport, Rab GTPase-activating proteins and specific signaling proteins that are degraded by selective autophagy <xref rid="pone.0113089-Birgisdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Colecchia1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Johansen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Svenning1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113089-Alemu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Several proteins such as Rab7 effector protein FYCO1 and two Rab guanosine triphosphatase-activating proteins including OATL1 (TBC1D25) and TBC1D5 can specifically bind to Atg8 family proteins, although these proteins are not substrates for autophagy but they directly or indirectly modulate critical process of autophagy such as interaction with lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate <xref rid="pone.0113089-Pankiv1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, fusion between autophagosome and lysosomes <xref rid="pone.0113089-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> or mediation of autophagosome maturation <xref rid="pone.0113089-Popovic1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Unlike PML-RAR&#x003b1; in which the second potential LIR motif (aa 621&#x02013;624) is missing due to gene translocation, PML over-expression can potentially increase sequestration of partial LC3 protein in PML NBs without enhancing autophagic activity, implying PML may control basic autophagy level by recruiting fraction of LC3 proteins within nuclear area. Therefore, experiments examining the role of PML in autophagy may elucidate their relationships. However, double mutant PML protein that lacks interaction capability with LC3 also did not affect the intracellular activity of autophagy as determined by detecting endogenous LC3 expression, which is similar to WT PML, suggesting that interaction of PML with LC3 may not directly participate in modulation of autophagy process. A previous study demonstrates that nuclear import-defective PML I targets early endosomes, and defective PML III, IV and V localize in late endosomes and lysosome <xref rid="pone.0113089-JulLarsen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, suggesting cytoplasmic portion of PML may associate with lysosome compartment, the critical organelle executing autophagy process.</p><p>Finally we elucidated potential role of PML-interacting with LC3. Our results showed that DM PML lost cell growth inhibition effect, which was conducted by WT PML, indicating that the interaction contributes to growth arrest function of PML. Relatively involved mechanism and whether this interaction could further influence other functions of PML (such as senescence and viral responses) deserved to be elucidated in future.</p><p>Collectively, our results propose that PML interacts with LC3 proteins and this interaction is dependent of LIR motifs and confers cell growth inhibition effect of PML. This work suggests that nuclear portion of LC3 may associate with PML to control cell growth for prevention and inhibition of cancer occurrence and development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professor Noboru Mizushima for kindly providing WT and ATG5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs. pFlag-CMV4-PML I plasmid was generously provided from Dr. Jian-Hua Tong in Shanghai Institute of Hematology (SIH).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113089-Melnick1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
