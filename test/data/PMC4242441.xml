We examined the effect of a short exposure to AA at different stages of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. AA caused the upregulation of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2) following 24 h of differentiation. This was mediated by the prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>), as inhibition of cyclooxygenases or PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> receptor signaling counteracted the AA-mediated aP2 induction. In addition, calcium, protein kinase C, and ERK are all key elements of the pathway through which AA induces the expression of aP2. We also show that treatment with AA during the first 24 h of differentiation upregulates the expression of the transcription factor Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) via the same pathway. Finally, treatment with AA for 24 h at the beginning of the adipocyte differentiation is sufficient to inhibit the late stages of adipogenesis through a Fra-1-dependent pathway, as Fra-1 knockdown rescued adipogenesis. Our data show that AA is able to program the differentiation potential of preadipocytes by regulating gene expression at the early stages of adipogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>prostaglandins</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Adipocytes are the primary site for fat storage with 90% of the adipocytes&#x02019; cytoplasm containing a large lipid droplet (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Apart from their role in fat storage, adipocytes are the major players in handling the lipid distribution across the body. Adipocytes can synthesize and take up lipids by sensing insulin, and can also hydrolyze and secrete lipids in response to &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor signaling. In addition, adipose tissue is a well-characterized endocrine organ that secretes hormones and regulates lipid homeostasis across the body (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Adipogenesis, the process of adipocyte differentiation, was initially thought not to proceed beyond the formation of adipose tissue, i.e., after the prenatal and early postnatal period. However, data have shown that new adipocytes can be formed during adulthood (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Dietary fat has been correlated with increased adipocyte number (hyperplasia) and size (hypertrophy) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, it is now apparent that this is a simplistic view, as fats have different effects on adiposity depending on their nature and properties. The role of arachidonic acid (AA), a major n-6 PUFA, on obesity is controversial from studies using both in vivo and in vitro models (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, it has been demonstrated that the protein/carbohydrate ratio in the diet can determine the role of AA on adiposity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). AA can be metabolized to a diverse group of metabolites, depending on the presence and activity of catalyzing enzymes. Prostaglandins (PGs), the products of AA generated by cyclooxygenases (COXs), have opposing effects on adipogenesis, as prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and 15-deoxy-&#x00394;<sup>12,14</sup> prostaglandin J<sub>2</sub> (PGJ<sub>2</sub>) promote (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> (PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>) inhibit adipocyte differentiation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Due to the important role of lipids in adipocytes, it is not surprising that fatty acid protein 4 (FABP4 or aP2) constitutes 5% of the total protein of an adipocyte (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). aP2 is a lipid chaperone binding hydrophobic ligands that facilitates the transport of lipids to specific compartments in the cell (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), interacts with various players of the regulatory mechanisms of adipocyte function (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and translocates to the nucleus affecting gene expression (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the function of aP2 is still poorly understood, as aP2 knockout mice show insulin sensitivity in the context of both dietary and genetic obesity, but not in lean mice (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The expression of aP2 is induced during adipocyte differentiation, as it is transcriptionally controlled by the master regulator of adipogenesis, PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). PPAR&#x003b3; is activated by natural (fatty acids) or synthetic agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), which also lead to aP2 upregulation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Activator-protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors have been implicated in both adipogenesis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and regulation of aP2 expression (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The AP-1 family consists of the Fos [Fos-related antigen (Fra)-1, c-Fos, FosB, and Fra-2] and Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), which can heterodimerize (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Fra-1 is an AP-1 factor that is of particular interest in adipogenesis, as Fra-1 transgenic mice have severe lipodystrophy with Fra-1 inhibiting CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &#x003b1; (C/EBP&#x003b1;) expression (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It is induced early in the adipocyte differentiation program (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and its expression is enhanced by PPAR&#x003b3; agonists (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), fatty acids (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), mitogens (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and insulin (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Little is known about Fra-1 target genes in preadipocytes and its mode of action, as it could be both an activator and a repressor (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>As AA is a major n-6 PUFA and a significant signaling molecule abundant in the Western diet, it is important to understand how it regulates adiposity through the process of adipocyte differentiation. Hence, the current study aimed to elucidate the effects of AA at the early stages of adipogenesis and delineate the events initiated by AA to program the differentiation ability of preadipocytes. We demonstrate that AA, after 24 h of treatment, is metabolized by COXs to generate PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, which binds to its membrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the FP receptor, and in turn induces the calcium/protein kinase C (PKC)/ERK signaling pathway that causes the upregulation of aP2 and Fra-1 expression. We also show that the inhibition of terminal differentiation by AA present at the early stages of adipogenesis is Fra-1-dependent, as Fra-1 knockdown could rescue the inhibitory effect of AA on differentiation.</p><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Carbaprostacyclin (cPGI<sub>2</sub>), AL 8810, baicalein, and 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) were purchased from Cayman Chemical. 15-Deoxy-&#x00394;<sup>12,14</sup> PGJ<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, SC-560, SC-236, and indomethacin were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

These doses were selected because fatty acids can be found in the plasma of fed or fasted mice between a range of 0.1 to 1.2 mM and have been used in prior in vitro studies (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Initially, we observed that lipid droplet formation was increased proportionally with the AA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). To examine whether AA promotes the early terminal differentiation of preadipocytes, the expression of late gene markers of differentiation was assessed, such as aP2, PPAR&#x003b3;2, C/EBP&#x003b1;, and FAS, following 24 h of treatment with AA. aP2 was the only late differentiation gene marker that was upregulated by AA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). A significant, but not as dramatic, increase in aP2 levels was also observed following 24 h treatment with AA in the absence of MDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>).

We show that AA upregulates the expression of aP2 and Fra-1 in preadipocytes, two genes with important roles in adipogenesis. The first step of the signaling cascade is the metabolism of AA by COXs in preadipocytes. The expression of both COX isoforms is affected by the presence of AA (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), but also by agents included in the adipocyte differentiation cocktail (MDI) that elevate cAMP levels (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), suggesting possible synergistic pathways activated by AA and MDI regulating aP2 expression.</p><p>Several classes of prostanoids are synthesized in preadipocytes and PGs have been implicated in adipocyte differentiation having opposing effects.

We identified that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, over the other PGs produced, mediates the AA-activated increase in aP2 and Fra-1 expression in the early stages of adipogenesis. Our data and the fact that the levels of PGs are higher in preadipocytes compared with differentiated adipocytes (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), indicate that there is a window early in adipogenesis when preadipocytes are sensitive to specific stimuli and respond with the production of PGs.</p><p>PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> signals via the FP receptor, a GPCR known to couple to G&#x003b1;q/11. This receptor is linked with a variety of downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of different kinases. In this study, we identified that AA, via PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> FP receptor activation, causes a transient calcium response and activation of PKC and ERK, which upregulate aP2 and Fra-1 expression. ERK signaling has been shown to be important for the early steps of the adipocyte differentiation program (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), but also for AA metabolism, as COX-2 is also regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway via the FP receptor (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In addition, ERK is an important regulator of Fra-1 expression (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), activating its transcription (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), stabilizing Fra-1 protein (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and regulating Fra-1 transactivation activity (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). ERK signaling can regulate cellular differentiation depending on the strength, duration, and location of ERK activity (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and in the context of adipogenesis, sustained ERK activation can inhibit differentiation (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our data suggest that the sustained ERK activation by AA in preadipocytes leads to the upregulation of aP2 and Fra-1 expression.</p><p>AA itself, but also 15-deoxy-&#x00394;<sup>12,14</sup> PGJ<sub>2</sub>, have been described to be direct ligands for PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), making AA a good candidate for regulating adipogenesis. However, in vitro cell models yielded different results, showing AA to act both pro-adipogenically and anti-adipogenically (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Animal feeding studies showed the same conflicting results (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and a similar scenario was also observed in studies of COX-2 (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, it has been proposed that cAMP levels govern the action of AA on adipogenesis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Our results reveal that Fra-1 upregulation by AA in preadipocytes is the key event in the mechanism by which short-term exposure to AA can program the differentiation potential of preadipocytes. Thus, the diversity found in different cell and animal models could lie in the different Fra-1 expression levels likely to be governed by ERK activation, a strong Fra-1 regulator. In addition, our observations are in agreement with in vivo data, as depleting Fra-1 in 3T3-L1 cells does not perturb differentiation (this study) in accord with normal adipose tissue observed in Fra-1 knockout mice (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). A defect is apparent when Fra-1 is overexpressed, as it appears to act as a brake on the differentiation procedure, inasmuch as Fra-1 transgenic mice become lipodystrophic (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Fra-1 can cause the inhibition of differentiation still remains to be determined. It has been shown that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;,</sub> via ERK activation, can inhibit PPAR&#x003b3; activity (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), raising the possibility that Fra-1 is acting through PPAR&#x003b3;, as shown for Fra-2 (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It is possible that early in differentiation, AA could modulate PPAR&#x003b3; activity by phosphorylation via the production of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, which in turn can decrease the transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x003b3;, inhibiting future maturation. In addition, new data suggest that aP2 can also inhibit adipocyte differentiation by downregulating PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Thus, our study suggests that upregulation of both aP2 and Fra-1, in response to AA, inhibits adipogenesis and highlights their increasingly evident importance in adipocyte differentiation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report showing that AA, through PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> signaling, regulates aP2 and Fra-1 expression at the early stages of preadipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that Fra-1 upregulation at the early stages causes the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by AA, opening new possibilities to manage diet-induced obesity.</p></sec>
