partial decrease in vestibular function is observed, which is characterized by abnormally
reduced responses to the caloric test unilaterally. Disorders, such as vestibular
schwannoma, vestibular neuritis, infections, and trauma affecting the inner ear, that can
lead to destruction of the sensorineural epithelium of the membranous labyrinth and/or
vestibular nerve fibers are diagnosed as UVH. Besides dizziness, the clinical picture of UVH
may include nystagmus, ocular torsion, oscillopsia, postural instability, gait disorders,
anxiety, depression, and fear. UVH patients commonly share the same symptoms, in spite of
differences regarding the etiology, onset, and clinical findings of dysfunction or the type
and extent of the vestibular deficit<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For a person with vestibular hypofunction, the main aims of treatment by the health-care
providers are restoring function or preventing further dysfunction. To deliver an effective
rehabilitation program to them, these patients need to be evaluated and diagnosed properly.
Routine diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction has been based on the results of conventional
methods such as the head thrust test (HTT), the horizontal head-shaking nystagmus test, and
the caloric test<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other than these tests,
previous studies have used a variety of outcome measures including dynamic posturography,
the motion sensitivity quotient (for rapid head movements), and the self assessed Dizziness
Handicap Inventory (DHI-Jacobson and Newman, 1990). Apart from these, advanced techniques
like electronystagmography (ENG), videonystagmography (VNG), and rotational chair tests have
also been used for measurement of vestibulo-ocular function, and computerized dynamic
posturography (CDP) incorporates all three modalities to effect an assessment of static and
dynamic stance. The Sensory Organization Test (SOT) protocol of CDP evaluates the patient&#x02019;s
ability to use the three systems that are chiefly responsible for maintaining upright,
volitional, balanced posture: vision, the vestibular system, and proprioception. But the
cost and time required to perform these tests are factors that keep them from being used in
general clinics<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Even though <bold>t</bold>he sensitivity of the HTT for identifying individuals with
vestibular hypofunction is relatively good, there are studies that prove that it is more
sensitive in patients with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH) than in patients with
UVH<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. While various clinical measures
have been developed to document UVH, the limitations of these tests are in the lack of
specificity for screening the unilateral vestibular deficit. Thus, there is a need for a
simple quantitative objective test to screen for unilateral vestibular hypofunction, and for
this reason, the Sideways Stepping Test (SST) or Fukuda Stepping Test (FST) could be a valid
and reliable diagnostic tool for detecting UVH. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
investigate whether SST is both a sensitive and specific test for detection of UVH as it is
effective, safe, and economical and therefore can be used widely throughout the world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted in a private Otolaryngology (ENT) Department in Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia. Twenty-eight adults participated in the study (15 male and 13 females).
Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to the start of the study. The
study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Review Board of
the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah. All the
participants were required to complete and clear the following comprehensive screening
tests: cervical instability test, modified vertebral artery test (mVAT), spontaneous
(resting) nystagmus test, smooth pursuit test, saccadic eye movement test, and vestibular
ocular reflex (VOR) cancellation test to rule out all central mediated problems. Only
subjects complaining of peripheral dizziness who were between the ages of 25 and 55&#x02005;years
old and able to ambulate independently were included in the study. Subjects with central
mediated problems such as stroke, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis, or peripheral
neuropathy were excluded from the study. Moreover, subjects who could not ambulate
independently, were blind, were profoundly deaf or had cervical spine pathology were also
excluded. The major outcome variables for confirming the presence of UVH were obtained by
the SST and the gold standard test, which is head-shaking nystagmus HSN test using video
electronystagmography (VENG). Both tests were performed by blinded assessors.</p><p>After completing all the screening tests, the patients were evaluated for UVH, starting
first with the SST. In this test, the subject is asked to stand with their feet together and
their hands by their sides. The subject is then asked to close his/her eyes or is
blindfolded. The test is positive if there is involuntary leaning to one side and hip sway.
Sometimes, the subject lifts a hand to compensate. In that case, the subject is asked to
take two steps sideways and stop, first with the eyes open and then with the eyes closed or
blindfolded. The test was positive if there is any involuntary swaying and/or any steps
taken to compensate. The suject is then asked to jog on the spot for 30 seconds with the
eyes closed or blindfolded. There should be no deviation. The test is positive if there is
any involuntary drifting to one side or, in some cases, forward or backward. A positive test
should be repeatable on subsequent occasions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After finishing the SST, the subject is then evaluated with the HSN test using VENG, which
is the gold standard test used to determine whether a vestibular (inner ear) disease may be
the causative factor for a balance or dizziness problem and is one of the only tests
available today that can distinguish between a unilateral (one ear) and bilateral (both
ears) vestibular dysfunction. VENG testing consists of a series of tests designed to
document a person&#x02019;s ability to follow visual objects with their eyes and how well the eyes
respond to information from the vestibular system. To monitor the movements of the eyes,
infrared goggles are placed around the eyes to record eye movements during testing. However,
during VENG testing, the therapist moves the patient&#x02019;s head and body into various positions
to make sure that there are no inappropriate eye movements (nystagmus), when the patient&#x02019;s
head is in different positions. HSN is a latent spontaneous vestibular nystagmus that can be
recorded with VENG. During the test for HSN, the examiner turns the subject&#x02019;s head by about
45 degrees horizontally about 20 times. HSN is defined as the occurrence of at least 5 beats
of nystagmus immediately after the head-shaking maneuver, which should be performed with
Frenzel VENG goggles. There is good evidence that HSN reflects a dynamic (peripheral and/or
central vestibular) asymmetry of the velocity storage mechanism. In peripheral lesions, the
ipsilateral dynamic VOR deficits can lead to an asymmetric accumulation within the velocity
storage, the discharge of which determines the direction of HSN, usually toward the
unaffected ear<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of both tests
were then compared with each other; the results should be the same in both tests.
Differences would decrease the efficiency of the SST.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Frequencies and relative frequencies were computed for nominal variables, and means and
standard deviations (SD) were computed for the continuous variables. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test

identify patients with UVH as an alternate method to the HSN test using VENG. Even though
there are many tests in practice for detecting vestibular hypofunction, all of them are used
to diagnose a bilateral vestibular hypofunction rather than UVH. As far as we know, this is
the first paper published based on the use of SST, which is reliable, easy to apply, and
cost effective, instead of the HSN test using VENG to diagnose a patient with UVH.</p><p>UVH is currently diagnosed using VENG, but some studies have shown that there is another
test that can be used for diagnosing UVH, namely, the SST. In 1959, Fukuda proposed a
variation of the Tretversuch test of <italic>Unterberger</italic> (1938) and the waltzing
test of <italic>Hirsch</italic> (1940) named the stepping test; that test is intended to
identify the weaker of the labyrinths (not necessarily the side with the lesion) by
direction of rotation of a patient while walking on the spot with the eyes closed<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Actually, some researchers have suggested
use of the SST in combination with other clinical tests (e.g., electronystagmography,
rotational chair, head thrust, and head shaking tests) in the assessment of vestibular
pathologies rather than using it in isolation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the purpose of this
study was to investigate whether the SST can be considered both a sensitive and specific
test for detection of UVH.</p><p>Based on our study results, we found a strong positive relationship between the SST and the
HSN test using VENG (65%), which indicates that the SST is an efficient test in the
diagnosis of UVH. Also, we found that the SST is both sensitive (able to pick up the
presence of any UVH in a person who has it) and specific (able to pick up the absence of any
UVH in a person who does not have it). So, it can be used to include or exclude the
dysfunction, but the results were better when it was used for inclusion. When using the HSN
test using VENG as the standard reference, our results showed adequate sensitivity and
specificity to support the use of SST as a screening test for unilateral vestibular
hypofunction.</p><p>A prospective study by Zhang et al. concluded that the FST was unreliable in identifying
the lesion side in acute vestibular dysfunction<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though some other studies also reported the same results and
conclusions<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, our study we found that the SST is a reliable and valid tool for
detection of UVH. The possible reasons for higher SST sensitivity and specificity in our
study than in other studies is the difference in the studied populations, with more subjects
with UVH in our sample, and the previous studies not being compared with any objective
standard method of testing.</p><p>The limitations of the present study were as follows. First, the number of subjects with
UVH in the study was limited. Second, there was great difficulty accessing patients and VENG
equipment, as there are very few otolaryngology (ENT) departments that are specialized in
our area. Third, we were unable to take pictures of the subjects for personal privacy
reasons. Therefore, we recommend that future research should be performed with a larger
number of subjects, should be experimental rather than an observational, and should measure
the sensitivity and specificity of the SST with regard to its ability to diagnose the side
of the dysfunction.</p><p>In conclusion, the study results showed that the SST is useful as an objective measure in
the evaluation of UVH in parallel with the HSN test using VENG. So the SST can be used as an
alternative to the HSN test using VENG for detection of UVH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz
