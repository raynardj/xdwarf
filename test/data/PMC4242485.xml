metastatic breast cancer remains dismal. Brain metastases present a particularly
difficult therapeutic target due to the &#x0201c;sanctuary&#x0201d; status of the brain, with
resulting inability of most chemotherapeutic agents to effectively eliminate
cancer cells in the brain parenchyma. A large number of breast cancer patients
receive various neuroactive drugs to combat complications of systemic anti-tumor
therapies and to treat concomitant diseases. One of the most prescribed groups of
neuroactive medications is anti-depressants, in particular selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Since SSRIs have profound effects on the brain, it is
possible that their use in breast cancer patients could affect the development of
brain metastases. This would provide important insight into the mechanisms
underlying brain metastasis. Surprisingly, this possibility has been poorly
explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We studied the effect of fluoxetine, an SSRI, on the development of brain
metastatic breast cancer using MDA-MB-231BR cells in a mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The data demonstrate that fluoxetine treatment increases the number of brain
metastases, an effect accompanied by elevated permeability of the blood&#x02013;brain
barrier, pro-inflammatory changes in the brain, and glial activation. This
suggests a possible role of brain-resident immune cells and glia in promoting
increased development of brain metastases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results offer experimental evidence that neuroactive substances may
influence the pathogenesis of brain metastatic disease. This provides a starting
point for further investigations into possible mechanisms of interaction between
various neuroactive drugs, tumor cells, and the brain microenvironment, which may
lead to the discovery of compounds that inhibit metastasis to the brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2407-14-598) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

incidence of fatal metastatic events remains high. Brain metastasis represents a
particularly challenging complication of breast cancer. It is estimated that 10-15%
of breast cancer patients have symptomatic brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]
and as many as 30% of patients reveal brain metastases on autopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].
The brain provides a unique microenvironment for tumor growth. It is a particularly
difficult therapeutic target due to the complexity of brain function as well as the
reduced ability of therapeutic agents to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In fact, many of the newest and
most effective treatments for primary tumors are ineffective in treating breast
tumor metastases in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is becoming increasingly clear
that prevention and treatment of metastatic brain tumors requires a better
understanding of the mechanisms that determine complex interactions between this
unique metastatic milieu and tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In this study we explore the mechanisms that underlie brain metastases by
investigating possible effects of antidepressant drug treatment on their
development. We present evidence that a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI), fluoxetine, facilitates increased brain-specific formation of breast cancer
metastases in a mouse model of the disease. This is accompanied by increased
permeability of the BBB and elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
indicating that fluoxetine treatment may promote the entry of cancer cells into the
brain via changes in the function of the BBB. This provides important insight into
the mechanisms governing breast tumor metastasis to the brain, and possible ways to
manipulate those mechanisms in order to reduce brain metastases. This approach has
additional clinical relevance because it has been well documented that up to 25% of
women with breast cancer suffer from clinical depression, a much higher percentage
compared to the incidence observed in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].
As a result, antidepressant drug use among breast cancer patients can be as high as
50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The SSRIs in particular have
found widespread use in the clinical management of breast cancer-associated
depression, hot flashes, and chemo brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently,
however, there has been increasing concern about pharmacologic interactions between
several SSRI antidepressants and anti-tumor medications used in breast cancer
therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several studies indicate that simultaneous
administration of these drugs may lead to decreased anti-tumor therapeutic
effectiveness and increased risk of recurrent breast cancer or death, due to drug
competition for binding sites at the relevant metabolic liver enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Even though these reports warrant further experimental
validation that considers genetic factors, patient drug compliance, and population
dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], there is no doubt that any clinical approach
to the prevention and treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer must take
into account possible adverse effects of prescription drug use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells</title><p>For intracardiac and tail-vein injections, we used the MDA-MB-231BR-GFP

mixture. A YFP-expressing CNS-1 rat glioma cell line was used for intracranial
injections, a generous gift from Dr. R. Mathews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. CNS-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of
hygromycin B. All cell growth media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). Cells were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination, with
consistently negative test results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Fluoxetine administration and cell injection</title><p>All animal experimental protocols were approved by the University of Rochester

before either intracardiac or tail-vein injections, and continued during the
3-week survival period. For stereotactic injections into the brain parenchyma,
animals were placed on dietary fluoxetine at 200&#x000a0;mg/L for 4&#x000a0;weeks before the cell
injections; fluoxetine administration continued for 1 additional week, at which
time brains were harvested. 231BR or CNS-1 cells were re-suspended in cold DPBS

spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)</title><p>Mice were treated with 200&#x000a0;mg/L of fluoxetine in drinking water for 30&#x000a0;days.
100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of serum was collected at day 0 and every 10&#x000a0;days throughout the fluoxetine
treatment. SRMs for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were performed by direct infusion
in the positive mode using 50% methanol with 0.1% formic acid. The parent ion m/z,
fragment ion m/z, collision energy, and tube lens voltage for the two compounds
were 296.1&#x000a0;m/z. 134.1&#x000a0;m/z, 5, 68 for fluoxetine; and 310.1&#x000a0;m/z, 44.3&#x000a0;m/z, 13, 66
for norfluoxetine. To extract the compounds from serum, 5 volumes of acetonitrile
(ACN) were added to the serum (500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of ACN to 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of serum), followed by
vortexing for 2&#x000a0;min and centrifugation at 16,000&#x000a0;g for 5&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000b0;C. The
supernatant was collected and dried down in a SpeedVac. The dried material was
reconstituted in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 50% methanol, and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l was injected for the LC-MS/MS
run. LC-MS/MS runs was performed at 40&#x000b0;C on a Thermo Quantum Access Max triple
quadropole mass spectrometer, with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC, configured with a
150 &#x000d7; 2.1&#x000a0;mm Accucore RP-MS column. The solvent system used 0.1% formic acid as
solvent A and 100% methanol as solvent B, with a gradient elution run, beginning
with 30% B for 0.5&#x000a0;minutes, ramping to 95% B over 1.5&#x000a0;minutes, holding at 95% B
for 1&#x000a0;minute, and returning to 30% B in 0.25&#x000a0;minutes, with a final 30% B
equilibration step for 2&#x000a0;minutes. Raw data files were imported into LCQUAN
software, including a standard curve spanning concentrations of 10 nM - 3.16&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M,
extracted from serum for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. Area under the curve
analysis was used to quantify the compounds in unknown samples.</p><p>Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A
reveals that after 10&#x000a0;days of treatment, the mean concentration of fluoxetine
reached 128&#x000a0;ng/ml, with the range of 55-243&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;ng/ml. After 20 and 30&#x000a0;days of
fluoxetine administration, the mean fluoxetine levels were 160 and 178&#x000a0;ng/ml, with
the range of 80-306&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25 and 24-363&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;39&#x000a0;ng/ml, respectively. The mean
norfluoxetine concentration at the 10-day time point was 282&#x000a0;ng/ml, with the range
of 140-479&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;41&#x000a0;ng/ml, whereas at the 20 and 30&#x000a0;day interval, the mean
norfluoxetine levels were 364 and 414&#x000a0;ng/ml, with the range of 74-532&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;41 and
153-579&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;46&#x000a0;ng/ml, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B). The serum levels of fluoxetine were within the
range reported previously for human serum samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, norfluoxetine concentration reached&#x02009;~&#x02009;twofold
higher levels than in human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], probably due to the differences in metabolic transformation
of the parent drug in mice versus humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Immunohistochemistry and image analysis</title><p>To quantify brain metastasis, mice injected intracardially with 231BR cells
were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were serially sectioned in the
coronal plane at 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. Sections were viewed on an AX70 Microscope (Olympus,
Center Valley, PA) using an epifluorescence setup. Digital images were obtained
using a MicroFire camera (Optronics, Muskogee, OK) and Image Pro software (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Images were analyzed in ImageJ by a blinded observer.
As reported previously in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we classified visible metastases as &#x0201c;macrometastases&#x0201d; or
&#x0201c;micrometastases&#x0201d; depending upon their size. Specifically, a cluster of cells that
was greater than 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in greatest extent was counted as a single
&#x0201c;macrometastasis&#x0201d; while any cells in a cluster smaller than 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in extent were
defined as multiple &#x0201c;micrometastases&#x0201d; and counted individually. To quantify lung
metastasis, lungs were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.
5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m serial sections were cut through the lungs at 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m intervals and stained
with hematoxylin-eosin. The number of lung metastases was determined in 4&#x02013;6 tissue
sections per animal by a blinded investigator using an AX70 Microscope (Olympus,
Center Valley, PA) in trans-illumination mode. To investigate brain-resident tumor
growth, the brains of mice injected with CNS-1 tumors were serially sectioned at
50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. The sections were imaged by a blinded observer as described for 231BR cells
above, and images were analyzed in ImageJ. Three measures were used to quantify
CNS-1 tumor growth: the number of brain sections containing cells, the total
number of tumor-containing pixels in the sections, and the maximum width that the
cells spread perpendicular to the initial injection track. Imaging parameters and
thresholds were kept constant between sections.</p><p>For immunohistochemistry (IHC), sections were washed in 0.1&#x000a0;M phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), followed by incubation in 1% hydrogen peroxide to block
endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, tissue was incubated in blocking solution
containing 0.3% Triton-X and 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 0.1&#x000a0;M PBS. After an
additional wash, the sections were incubated for 48&#x000a0;h in a humidified chamber at
4&#x000b0;C in primary antibody solution containing one of the following antibodies:
rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:500, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Richmond, VA); mouse
anti-IA/IE (1:200, BD Pharminogen, San Jose, CA); mouse anti-CD11b (1:200, AbD
Serotec, Raleigh, NC); mouse anti-CD45 (1:300, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC); mouse
anti-CD68 (1:800, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1500, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA); and Wisteria Floribunda Lectin (WFA) (1:500, Vector Laboratories).
The sections were subsequently washed and incubated for 4&#x000a0;h at room temperature
with either of the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 594 donkey
anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) or Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500)
(Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). The sections were washed, mounted, and
cover-slipped using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad,
CA).</p><p>Sections were viewed on an AX70 Microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) using
an epifluorescence setup. Digital images were obtained using a MicroFire camera
(Optronics, Muskogee, OK) and Image Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda,
MD). Images were analyzed by a blinded observer using ImageJ. To determine the
amount of glial staining in relation to distance from 231BR metastases, we created
binary masks of tumors and glial staining. The tumor mask was then expanded
iteratively by one pixel and the number of stained pixels within the region
defined by the tumor mask was measured to produce the fraction of stained pixels
as a function of distance from the edge of the tumor. All measurements were
confined to the brain area in which the tumor resided to correct for differences
in glial expression between brain areas. Tumors in control and fluoxetine groups
were not statistically different in size for all stains. WFA antibody was used to
visualize perineuronal nets in brain sections from animals that were injected with
231BR cells. To quantify WFA staining, background subtracted normalized average
pixel intensity value was determined for various brain regions and compared
between the control and fluoxetine groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Thinned skull imaging</title><p>Chronic imaging of mouse visual cortex was performed using a thinned skull
preparation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], using GFP-M mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that received 100&#x000a0;mg/L of fluoxetine in drinking water for
4&#x000a0;weeks. Briefly, a two-photon microscope with a Mai Tai laser (Spectra Physics)
and a modified Olympus Fluoview 300 confocal unit was used. An Olympus LUMPlan
fI/IR 20X/0.95NA was used to identify the binocular visual cortex based on
cortical vasculature; an area containing brightly labeled neurons was chosen for
imaging. 3D image stacks were obtained at high magnification to allow for
dendritic spine reconstruction in layers 1 and 2 of the visual cortex. After the
initial imaging session, the scalp was sutured and the animals were returned to
the animal facility. The animals were re-anesthetized 4&#x000a0;days later and the same
area was identified based on the blood vessel and dendritic patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. 3D image stacks of the same dendritic
regions were again obtained at high magnification. The percentage of lost and new
spines was determined relative to the total number of spines present in the
initial imaging session using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Proliferation and migration assay</title><p>For proliferation assays, 231BR cells were plated at 20,000 per well and

of incubation. Results are representative of two independent experiments. A
migration assay was performed using the FluoroBlok 24-well insert system with
8.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pore size (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). 231BR cells were grown for 48&#x000a0;h in
DMEM containing various fluoxetine concentrations, trypsinized, counted, and
seeded in serum-free DMEM/fluoxetine mixture onto the apical side of the insert at
50,000 per well. DMEM/fluoxetine with 10% FBS was added as a chemoattractant to
the basal chamber. Following overnight incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in 5%
CO<sub>2</sub>, cells were stained with calcein AM and then read on
a bottom reading fluorescent plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Evan&#x02019;s Blue spectroscopy</title><p>Mice were injected via tail vein with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/10&#x000a0;g body weight of 2% Evan&#x02019;s

the brain</title><p>To study the effects of fluoxetine on the ability of breast cancer cells to
metastasize to the brain, we pretreated Nu/Nu mice with fluoxetine for three weeks
prior to the intracardiac injection of 231BR breast cancer cells. Administration
of fluoxetine in drinking water resulted in therapeutic concentrations in the
serum as explain in the methods (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Three weeks post-injection, metastases in fixed brain sections
appeared either as isolated cells that could be readily distinguished and counted,
which we term &#x0201c;micrometastases&#x0201d;, or as large groups of interconnected cells which
could not be accurately distinguished and hence were counted as a single
&#x0201c;macrometastasis&#x0201d; by our blinded observer (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Animals that received fluoxetine demonstrated a 52% increase
in the total number of brain metastases compared with control: fluoxetine (n

perineuronal nets</title><p>Our results suggest that fluoxetine acts on the brain microenvironment to
enhance its capacity to foster metastasis. Two mechanisms that may contribute to
this effect are: an enhanced growth of the established tumors within the brain
parenchyma, or an increased ability for metastatic cells to penetrate the BBB. To
examine the former possibility we examined the extracellular environment of the
brain after fluoxetine treatment. Fluoxetine has been shown to modulate synaptic
plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], a process that is
dependent on remodeling of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ECM changes have the potential to influence
breast tumor growth within the brain, since the invasion process is critically
dependent upon the extracellular substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To determine whether fluoxetine treatment altered the
extracellular brain environment, we first assayed dendritic spine turnover
<italic>in vivo</italic>, a process that is highly sensitive
to brain ECM composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,

Dendritic spines, which are the postsynaptic structures of the majority of
excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, were imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> through a thinned-skull window on two separate
imaging sessions spaced four days apart. As expected, examination of dendritic
spine turnover revealed that animals in both the control (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) and fluoxetine (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) group demonstrate dynamic gain and loss of spines. However,
quantitative analysis showed no significant difference in the percentages of
either new or lost spines between the experimental groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), suggesting that fluoxetine does not enhance
structural plasticity at cortical synapses.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

composition, in particular on perineuronal nets (PNNs), a major component of the

neuronal plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and thus
could be a prime target of fluoxetine action. Brain tissue of mice that received
fluoxetine and were injected with 231BR cells was examined using a wisteria
floribunda antibody (WFA) that recognizes PNNs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). The average fluorescent intensity of WFA staining was
determined quantitatively across brain regions and compared between the control

regions, with primary and secondary somatosensory cortex exhibiting the highest
level of PNN expression. Areas of primary and secondary motor cortex, as well as
cingulate cortex, demonstrated somewhat lower WFA staining intensity, with
hippocampus having the lowest expression of PNNs. However, a comparison within
individual brain regions failed to reveal any difference between the control and
fluoxetine experimental groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). These results suggest that the increase in brain metastatic
ability of breast cancer cells elicited by fluoxetine treatment is not modulated
via large-scale changes in ECM either at synaptic sites or in PNNs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Effect of fluoxetine on tumor growth within the brain parenchyma</title><p>The lack of changes in dendritic spine dynamics and ECM structure suggests
that fluoxetine may facilitate the entry of cancer cells into the brain rather
than their subsequent growth within the brain parenchyma. This predicts that
tumors growth is not altered by fluoxetine once cells are established within the
brain. In support of this view, fluoxetine treatment did not affect the <italic>size</italic> of 231BR macrometastases: the average diameter was
1599&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17&#x000a0;a.u. in the fluoxetine group vs. 1547&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;49&#x000a0;a.u. in the control group, p

if fluoxetine was changing the brain microenvironment to foster growth of
established brain tumors, this should enhance the ability of any brain-resident
tumors to grow within the brain. To test this, we performed stereotactic
injections of a rat glioma cell line, CNS-1, into the frontal cortex of Nu/Nu
mice, in order to examine whether fluoxetine would affect brain tumor development
after introduction of malignant cells directly into the brain parenchyma. While
intracranial injection of CNS-1 cells led to the development of brain tumors in

the size, of metastases in a murine model of breast tumor metastasis to the brain.
This increase is accompanied by changes in the BBB and the inflammatory environment
of the brain, with no detectable changes in the properties of the brain ECM. These
results provide several insights into the possible mechanisms by which fluoxetine
alters brain metastasis, and hence possible avenues for future therapeutic
manipulation of the metastatic outcome.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Fluoxetine and the brain ECM</title><p>Fluoxetine is thought to exert its anti-depressant effects by promoting brain
plasticity, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These
processes are critically dependent on the brain ECM, as is tumor invasion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], suggesting that fluoxetine
could achieve its metastasis-altering effects in part by remodeling the
extracellular milieu of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We examined this possibility by focusing on an ECM component,
the PNN, which has been shown to play a critical role in modulating plastic
changes in the brain. PNNs are established during brain development, as inhibitory
and excitatory circuits mature and the brain becomes less plastic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Both enzymatic removal of PNNs and
fluoxetine treatment enhance plasticity in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, we detected no significant change in PNNs in
different brain areas after fluoxetine treatment, which suggests that the effects
of fluoxetine on brain plasticity and metastasis are mediated through a different
pathway. In agreement with this, synapse remodeling, a process that is highly
sensitive to the extracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], was also
not affected by fluoxetine. Given the apparent lack of fluoxetine-induced ECM
remodeling in our brain metastasis model, it is not surprising that neither the
size of breast tumor metastases established in the brain nor the size of resident
glioma tumors appeared sensitive to fluoxetine treatment in our experiments. These
results suggest that the effects of fluoxetine on the establishment of brain
metastasis are not mediated via the brain ECM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Fluoxetine treatment and glia</title><p>The pathogenesis of the vast majority of CNS diseases, including depression,
is mediated, at least in part, by inflammatory processes. Although fluoxetine acts
as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, it also has strong effects on peripheral immune
cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and brain resident immune
cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. We observed fluoxetine-induced alterations
in expression of several cytokines indicative of glial activation, and observed
that fluoxetine enhanced glial activation in the vicinity of established brain
metastases. This suggests that fluoxetine can alter inflammatory signaling in
vivo, and that this alteration may be a mechanism by which fluoxetine elevates
breast tumor metastasis to the brain in our murine model.</p><p>The contribution of microglia and astrocytes to the pathology of brain
resident tumors has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However,
their involvement in metastatic events is less clear. Several studies have
described activated glia associated with metastastic lesions in the brain
parenchyma, suggesting an important role for these cells in metastatic growth
within the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. While the immune function of these cells
could contribute to defending the brain against cancer cell invasion, it is
becoming clear that brain tumor cells can co-opt glia to promote tumor growth and
invasion. Tumor cells and glia undergo a complex molecular cross talk that
influences glial behavior and subsequent tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Activated glia can produce multiple cytokines, chemokines,
and enzymes that lead to increased tumor invasion, including IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], markers that were upregulated
in this study. Surprisingly, the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers after
fluoxetine treatment did not affect the growth of gliomas or breast tumor
metastasis already established in the brain, despite the fact that many of these
inflammatory molecules have been shown to play a significant role in tumor
survival and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Possibly, the source or extent
of fluoxetine-driven expression of these molecules is such as to change the entry
of cells into the brain but not affect their subsequent growth.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in our study, chronic fluoxetine treatment
<italic>increased</italic> inflammatory marker expression in
the brain, while other studies examining peripheral and brain effects of
fluoxetine have reported anti-inflammatory effects with <italic>reduced</italic> expression of markers such as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], although inflammatory effects of fluoxetine were also
observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There are several
possible reasons for this discrepancy. First, the majority of studies focus on the
effects of fluoxetine within the context of pathological inflammation due to
either LPS injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] or CNS
disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus the effects on
baseline inflammatory state have not been examined. Second, most studies examining
inflammatory markers have focused on <italic>in vitro</italic>
settings where cells behave differently than they do <italic>in
vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our data
suggest that fluoxetine, at neuroactive doses, can increase inflammatory signaling
<italic>in vivo</italic> in the <italic>absence of pathological changes in the brain</italic> and this in turn may
affect breast tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Inflammation and BBB</title><p>Glial cells, and astrocytes in particular, are critical elements of the BBB
and could influence tumor cell entry into the brain through its manipulation.
Glia-derived cytokines and proteases have been implicated in promoting cancer cell
navigation through the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, brain-resident glia are frequently localized
to the sites of cancer cell arrest in brain capillaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The intimate relationship between glia and
tumor cells that have not yet entered the brain might imply a role for glia in
shepherding tumor cells through the BBB. In addition, glial cells also produce
MCP-1, MIP-2, and RANTES (all of which were increased after fluoxetine treatment)
that could promote metastasis indirectly by stimulating infiltration into the
brain of peripheral cells with pro-tumor activities such as myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC), tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and tumor-associated
neutrophils (TAN). These cells may in turn contribute to the vicious circle of the
pro-invasion phenotype created by fluoxetine administration, via additional
secretion of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and other cytokines. Moreover, in the process of
infiltrating the brain parenchyma, MDSCs, TAMs, and TANs may create a &#x0201c;back door&#x0201d;
whereby cancer cells in the immediate vicinity can accompany the infiltrating
cells as they leave the capillaries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Fluoxetine treatment and the BBB</title><p>A surprising result of fluoxetine administration is significantly increased
BBB permeability even in the absence of circulating tumor cells. These data
suggest that fluoxetine may facilitate the entry of breast cancer cells into the
brain by affecting the function of the BBB directly rather than enhancing the
transport of tumor cells specifically. In other disease models such as CNS trauma,
ischemia and neurodegeneration, a number of pro-inflammatory mediators are
released by brain parenchymal cells, including endothelial cells and glia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. These mediators, including
IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, increase BBB permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] via altered
expression of tight-junction proteins as well as increased production of reactive
oxygen species and metalloproteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Therefore, the increased expression of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; that
we observed after fluoxetine administration may directly lead to the impairment of
BBB function and increased permeability of the barrier, thus precipitating
increased brain metastasis.</p><p>Another important step in tumor cell extravasation is cell arrest within the
blood vessels of the brain. Paracrine stimulation by pro-inflammatory molecules
such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and MIP-2, leads to increased synthesis of chemokines and
expression of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, E-selectin, and vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by cerebrovascular endothelial cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which may increase anchorage
of tumor cells and eventually lead to facilitated cellular invasion from the
circulation into the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].
These same changes may directly or indirectly lead to increased ability of MDSCs,
TAMs, and TANs to enter the brain and further influence tumor cell entry across
the BBB. Additionally, inflammatory expression may influence the survival of tumor
cells within the vasculature and thus enhance the probability of brain
metastasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data provide the first experimental evidence that a neuroactive drug can
promote increased entry of cancer cells into the brain parenchyma. The results of
this study suggest a novel drug-induced, brain-specific mechanism whereby
permeability of the BBB is altered by 1) the effect of fluoxetine on cellular
components of the brain microenvironment to stimulate production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines that can in turn modulate BBB function, 2) direct effect of fluoxetine on
the components of the barrier, or 3) a combination of these two mechanisms. These
findings suggest that neuroactive drugs used to treat depression and chemo brain in
patients need to be carefully screened for unexpected effects on brain metastasis.
In addition, they open new opportunities in the search for pharmacologic drugs that
would inhibit brain metastasis by restricting permeability of the BBB or,
conversely, would improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain by opening
up the BBB. Such drugs would have the advantage of targeting the brain rather than
the heterogeneous and rapidly mutating tumor cell and could be used to limit
brain-specific metastasis of many different primary tumor types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec27"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12885_2014_5016_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Additional file 1: Figure S1: Fluoxetine reaches
