exercise program based on motor learning on balance ability and strength of the lower
extremity in the elderly with/without falling experiences. [Subjects and Methods]
Individuals who had experiences of falling over 2 times within the past 6 months were
included in the falling group. The task-specific exercise program consisted of 3 stages
(weeks 1&#x02013;2, 3&#x02013;4, and 5&#x02013;6) and was conducted according to the level of difficulty in this
study. [Results] The scores of the Korean version of the Activities-Specific Balance
Confidence Scale and Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment were significantly changed
in both the falling group and non-falling group after the task-specific exercise program.
In comparisons between the falling group and non-falling group, there were also
significant differences in the Korean version of the Activities-Specific Balance
Confidence Scale and muscle strength of the semitendinosus and gastrocnemius. [Conclusion]
The task-specific exercise program has a positive effect on balance ability and muscle
strength related to falls in the elderly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Falling</kwd><kwd>Task-specific exercise</kwd><kwd>Elderly people</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Falling can occur anytime in life, especially in the elderly over 65&#x02005;years old. Thirty to
50% of elderly individuals have experienced falling, and 40% of them have been injured by
falling<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle strength in the lower
extremities is well known as an important factor for falling, and muscle endurance and
balance ability are also known to be necessary in order to prevent falling<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Interventions such as exercise, education, and complex programs have been widely used to
prevent falling. In a previous study, multifactorial intervention combining an exercise
program and education was introduced as the most effective way to prevent falling, because
falling is comprehensively affected by many factors such as physical, psychological,
environmental, and social factors<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, in previous studies, the exercise focused on only one specific task, and the
effects of exercise hardly relate to the improvement of ADL. Furthermore, there are not many
studies about the effect of multi-factorial intervention. Thus, the purpose of this study
was to investigate the effect of task-specific exercise program, which is one of
multifactorial interventions, on muscle strength and balance ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty elderly individuals over 65 of age were randomly recruited and divided into two
groups (FG = falling group, nFG = non-falling group) based on their responses to a
questionnaire survey. That is, those that had fallen more than 2 times in the past 6
months were included in FG. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) able to normally
perform ADL, 2) scored over 21 in the Korean Version of the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE-K), 3) no orthopedic disease, and 4) no participation in an exercise program within
3 months. All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written

was conducted according to the level of difficulty in this study. The next level of the
program was performed only after the earlier level had been completed and all subjects
performed the program for an hour a day, three times a week for 6 weeks. Warming up mainly
consisted of self-stretching exercises, and the method of performing and purpose of the
task were demonstrated to subjects during the warm-up period. A modified task-specific
exercise program consisting of balance training, gait training, and strengthening was
applied in this study. The warm-up exercises included trunk elevation, trunk rotation,
trunk flexion and knee flexion/extension while standing. Sufficient time to rest was
provided according to the subjects&#x02019; conditions and the subjects were instructed to
immediately stop performing an exercise if they felt any pain. Joint stretching
(extension) was also performed for 10 minutes to cool down after the exercise.</p><p>The task-specific exercise program was conducted under the careful monitoring of 3
physical therapists who had more than 5&#x02005;years of clinical experience. The exercise program
was as follows:</p><p>(1) Stage 1 (weeks 1&#x02013;2): sit-to-stand, steps (anterior/posterior, right/left), 10&#x02005;m of
waking (anterior/posterior, right/left), squat exercise, stanfing on the tiptoes.</p><p>(2) Stage 2 (weeks 3&#x02013;4): Stage 1 + 10&#x02005;m walk from sitting position on a chair and back,
toe extension while squatting.</p><p>(3) Stage 3 (weeks 5&#x02013;6): Stage 2 + tandem walking, kicking a ball and retrieving the
ball.</p><p>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) was developed by Power and
Myer<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It consists of a total 16
specific items that demonstrate whether a subject is able to maintain their balance and
confidently perform the activities or not. The score is divided from 0 to 100%, and the
scores of each item are summed to calculate the total score.</p><p>The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) was conducted to evaluate mobility
and the risk of falls. The POMA which was developed by Tinetti, is a 3-point scale and is
helpful on measuring falling risk, balance ability and mobility<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. POMA-T (POMA total) consists of two parts, POMA-balance
(max score: 16 score) and POMA-gait (max score: 12 score).</p><p>A myotonometer (Neurogenic Technologies Inc., Missoula, MT, USA) was also used to measure
the lower muscle strength in this study. A myotonometer can measure muscle strength by
digitizing the muscle activation and muscle strength. In this study, the middle of each
muscle was measured by compressing it with 1.5&#x02005;kg of pressure applied by pressing on it
with the myotonometer during maximum isometric contraction of the muscle. The vastus
medialis, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and
gastrocnemius were measured in this study. The muscle belly of each muscle was the
measurement point, and the point was marked with a pen before measurement. In addition,
each measurement was repeated 3 times, and the mean value was used for statistical
analysis. Values were expressed in millimeters, and a lower value indicates higher muscle
strength.</p><p>PASW 18.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis in this study. FG and nFG were
compared with Levene&#x02019;s F-test followed by the independent t-test. The paired t-test was
also used to compare the differences in balance ability and lower muscle strength between
before and after the intervention in both groups. Furthermore, the independent t-test was
used again to compare the differences between the two groups. The level of significance
was &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The scores for the K-ABC and POMA were significantly changed in both FG and nFG after the

These programs are well known as effective
approaches, since activities consisting of functional tasks could interact with the related
organs in the programs. In a previous study, it was reported that a task-specific program
was effective for improvement of standing, functional movement, balance, muscle endurance,
and gait<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the K-ABC and POMA were used to evaluate balance ability. The K-ABC scores
significantly from 53.8&#x000b1;7.8 and 73.5&#x000b1;5.8 to 59.4&#x000b1;6.3 and 76.7&#x000b1;7.3 in FG and nFG.
Respectively, after the intervention, The POMA scores were also increased from 17.3&#x000b1;4.6 to
22.8&#x000b1;3.9 in FG and from 19.6&#x000b1;3.4 to 23.6&#x000b1;3.2 in nFG after the intervention. These results
are in line with the results of the study of Leroux, who investigated the effects of
task-specific exercise on balance ability in patients with stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, Kim et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that dynamic balance was increased after task-specific
exercise. These results support our study, which found that a task-specific exercise program
may positively affect the balance ability in the elderly population.</p><p>A previous study reported that muscle weakness is the main factor for falls and closely
related to balance and gait ability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
That is, quality of life and activities of daily living could be influenced by muscle
weakness in the elderly. In this study, there were significant changes not only in the
vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, and gastrocnemius in FG but also in the
vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius in nFG after the 6-week task-specific
exercise program. In addition, the increase in muscle strength was smaller in FG, compared
with nFG. That is, the task-specific exercise program is effective for lower muscle strength
in elderly individuals who have experienced falls, and a program for prevention of falls has
to include muscle strengthening exercise for the semitendinosus and gastrocnemius. Krebs
reported lower muscle strength increased by 26% after 6 weeks of task-specific exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Yang reported a 61.5% increase in
lower muscle strength after a 4-week program<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results would be caused by improvement of lower muscle
strength and balance as a result of the positive effects of repeated movements in a
task-specific exercise program<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. First, it is a little difficult to generalize the
results because of the small number of subjects. Second, continuous effects of the program
were not evaluated. Third, the difficulty level was not controlled because the exercise
program which was designed for CNS impairment, was applied to normal elderly individuals.
Thus, further study compensating for these limitations will be needed.</p><p>This study was implemented to investigate the effect of a task-specific exercise program
based on motor learning on balance ability and strength of the lower extremity in elderly
people with/without falling experiences. The K-ABC and POMA scores, which used for analysis
of balance ability, were significantly increased in both groups. Thus, the task-specific
exercise program is thought to be effective for improvement of balance in the elderly. In
FG, the extensor and flexor muscles of the hip joint were significantly increased, and in
nFG, the dorsiflexor and plantar-flexor muscles were also significantly increased.
Furthermore, there were significant differences in the K-ABC and lower muscle strength
(semitendinosus and gastrocnemius) between FG and nFG. That is, the task-specific exercise
program has a positive effect on balance ability and muscle strength related to falls in the
elderly strength in the elderly related to falls.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sherrington</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lord</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Close</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A simple tool predicted probability of falling after aged
