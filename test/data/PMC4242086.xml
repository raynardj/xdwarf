The study period was from 1 September 2012 to 1 April 2013, during which time, consecutive patients admitted under the medical team with pneumothorax were identified by the daily departmental handover lists. Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with a chest drain in situ for the purpose of treating pneumothorax and who were able to consent were eligible for the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>The objectives of this pilot study were (1) to gain and document experience of the use of using digital drainage system in the management of pneumothorax in patients with primary/secondary/iatrogenic pneumothorax; (2) to subjectively evaluate patient, nurse and physician satisfaction of the use of this system in pneumothorax and (3) to gather observational data about the recorded air leak and analyse whether this data appeared to relate to the patient outcome (ie, when the drain was removed and whether the patient required surgery). There was no intention to perform statistical analysis as it was anticipated that the sample size would be small (between 10 and 15 participants were expected based on the admission rates with pneumothorax from the previous year). Qualitative data about the use of the device in management of this condition and the experience of patients and staff was sought.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients suitable for the study were approached by the principal investigator who was independent from the clinical team who had responsibility for the patients care. The study was discussed with each patient and written information provided about the study and written consent was gained. Once a patient had consented to enter the study the principal investigator changed the underwater seal chest drain bottle for the digital device (Thopaz) which took under 2&#x02005;min. Participants were cared for on respiratory wards where nursing staff and junior doctors were trained on the use of the device.</p><p>The device provides continuous recording of the air leak in mL/min and the graphical display screen allows the prior 24&#x02005;h&#x02019; data to be viewed. The physician in charge of the case was able to access this information to guide clinical decision-making. It was suggested (from experience used in surgical cohorts) that it would be reasonable to remove the chest drain when the data showed that the air leak had been &#x0003c;10&#x02005;mL/min for greater than 6&#x02005;h. Over the course of the study this advice was changed (see results section for explanation) to a recording of 0&#x02005;mL/min for more than 12&#x02005;h. However, it was ultimately the decision of the physician who had responsibility for the case to decide when to remove the drain, if and when to apply suction and if and when to refer for surgery. Physicians could choose to reattach an underwater seal either temporarily or permanently at any time.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Analysis</title><p>At the end of the patient episode, data from each device was downloaded and correlated with the patient's medical notes. Each patient was asked to complete a brief questionnaire about their satisfaction with the device. After 120&#x02005;days following discharge the patient's medical records were searched to determine if there had been a recurrence of the pneumothorax and whether the patient was still alive. At the end of the study period nurses who had been involved with caring for patients who had used the device were asked to complete a brief questionnaire on their experience of using the device. Physicians who had clinical responsibility for patients using the device were asked to comment on their experience of using the device.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics of participants</title><p>Fifteen patients were admitted over the study periods that were suitable for the study.

The blue line shows the pressure recordings over this time. As the flow decreases, the amplitude of this pressure recording increases. The patient is able to regulate their own pleural pressure which Medela suggests is another indication that the drain could now be removed based on research by Brunellia <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

Although the leak is relatively small (maximum 100&#x02005;mL/min) and reads as little as 1&#x02005;mL for several hours at a time it is persistent. There is a spike in the waveform at intervals of 15&#x02013;20&#x02005;h which heralds a period of several hours of increased flow. The pleural pressure wave is of low amplitude. This patient required surgery for on-going air leak.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Clinical outcome</title><p>Patient records were checked at 120&#x02005;days after admission. There were no episodes of recurrence in patients whose pneumothorax had resolved. One patient had a persistent air leak (92&#x02005;days) which resolved following insertion of endobronchial valve. Two patients had died, one at day 58th day (after the original admission) of respiratory failure and the other at day 24th day due to metastatic laryngeal cancer. Two patients underwent VATS during their inpatient admission and two patients have been referred to surgeons as outpatients. The median hospital stay was 3.5&#x02005;days (range 1&#x02013;92&#x02005;days) and the median time device was in situ was 4&#x02005;days (range 1&#x02013;29&#x02005;days).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Patient experience of using the device</title><p>Patient satisfaction with the device was high with most patients reporting no problems with the system during their admission. One patient became very anxious about the device and the data being generated. They kept an independent log of the recordings from the device and tried to alter the settings themselves. Another patient commented that &#x0201c;I prefer the Thopaz system over the bottle due to its precise measurements, flexibility and ease of transport&#x0201d;. It was possible for one patient to be treated within the community, with close follow-up by the principal investigator. Another patient asked for the device to be changed back to an underwater seal as he felt that it was the connection of his drain to the device which had caused it to fall out; it was our opinion that the reason for the drain falling out was not related to the Thopaz device.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Nursing experience of using the device</title><p>Nurse satisfaction with the device was high and all who returned the questionnaire rating their overall impression of the device as very good or excellent. All of those surveyed (nine) said that they preferred the Thopaz to the conventional underwater seal. One of the nursing sisters commented that &#x0201c;the Thopaz drains have been very easy to integrate onto the ward. The main benefits I can see are that the patient can mobilise while on suction and the drain does not have to be kept on the floor&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Physician experience of using the device</title><p>The experience of the five senior thoracic physicians with clinical responsibility for the study patients was mixed. There was generally good agreement on the management of each case according to the clinical course and data that the device provided. Four of the five physicians said that they would be happy to change to using this device routinely. Issues raised included concerns about when it was reasonable to remove the drain. Surgical units suggested removal of drains was safe when the flow rate was less than 20&#x02005;mL for 6&#x02005;h. This was used as a guide for the first few patients. However, patient 7 had flow which was intermittent, and flow was 0 for up to 12&#x02005;h before restarting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJRESP2014000033F3">figure 3</xref>). This patient required video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). There were no operative findings to specifically explain the intermittent nature of the leak. Following this, the principal investigator advised a more conservative approach, with it being safe to remove a drain when the reading was 0 for 12&#x02005;h or more. There was concern on the part of one of the senior physicians as to whether this was truly necessary and indeed what the clinical significance of such low flow actually was. One of the physicians felt more confident with clamping the drain (when flow read zero) and following clamping the drain was successfully removed.</p><p>Another issue was the fact that the device only allowed the user to look back at 24&#x02005;h&#x02019; worth of data. Although this was not an issue during the working week it was not possible to review weekend data. This has been raised with the company who plan to extend the time period it is possible to view data for on the device to up to 72&#x02005;h. During the study there was a high turnover of nurses and junior doctors on the ward. The principal investigator carried out training for all staff likely to come into contact with the device on the ward. However, out of hours doctors from other specialties were asked to review patients on the ward who were not familiar with the device, which raised concerns.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The 2010 British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest that patients with a persistent air leak should be discussed with a thoracic surgeon after 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;days<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> although the ideal timing for surgical intervention is unclear.

The first is a case series of three postoperative patients in Spain which reported a successful outcome.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There has only been one case report of this device being used in the community for pneumothorax<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> of a Scottish patient with severe idiopathic interstitial lung disease who developed pneumothorax. She was successfully treated for 4&#x02005;weeks in the community following an initial inpatient stay of 116&#x02005;days. Eventually her drain was removed without complications.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of the Thopaz drainage system in medical patients with pneumothorax. This pilot study has indicated that the Thopaz digital drainage system may have a useful role in pneumothorax management. The system appears to be subjectively acceptable to patients and staff. Training of staff is important when using digital devices which will be unfamiliar to most staff caring for medical patients. This small pilot study did not identify any safety concerns. Retrospective analysis of graphical data appears to indicate that this might be useful to predict earlier chest drain removal and predict a persistent leak requiring surgical intervention. Where flow rates are falling rapidly and pressure wave amplitude is increasing it seems likely that the air leak will resolve without surgical intervention, whereas if the flow rate still has spikes prior to high activity with a low amplitude pressure wave the converse may be true. It is possible that the ability to make such decisions sooner would reduce the length of inpatient stay, although this study is not designed to look at this issue specifically. A criticism of the Thopaz system only allows review of prior 24&#x02005;h of data on the device. A printout over several days seems to be desirable to help decision-making.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First it had a heterogeneous group of patients. It is unclear as to which patients may benefit from the use of digital air leak monitoring over the conventional system in the management of their pneumothorax. Second, we recognise that this study of only 13 patients is not powered to draw robust conclusions about the benefit of digital devices or to clearly state when suction should be applied or indeed the exact timing of chest drain removal. Third, we recognise that the study was performed at a centre, which had thoracic surgery on site, and that this may influence the referral practice for surgical intervention.</p><p>Despite these limitations and potential bias, we believe that the use of digital devices from our preliminary findings should be subjected to a randomised controlled trial to determine if the described data parameters can be used to predict earlier chest drain withdrawal or prompt referral for surgical intervention. Although this has been studied in surgical populations it is our belief that this does not necessarily translate to medical patient groups who have a different mechanism of air leak and in whom healing may not occur by the same mechanism as in postoperative patients. We hope our findings will inform the criteria for inclusion in such a trial as well as providing guidance as to drainage parameters that might be used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we feel that this small pilot study has shown that digital devices in pneumothorax may be beneficial tool for decision-making. The device studied appeared safe, well tolerated and acceptable to staff and patients. We suggest that a randomised controlled trial is needed to gain a better understanding of how flow and pressure patterns in medical patients with pneumothorax indicates the eventual outcome and how this can guide the clinician in the management of these patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Lucy Schomberg.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> GT has designed the study, sought ethical approval, gathered data and written the current paper.
