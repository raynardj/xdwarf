upper limb in a supine position on the muscle activity of a healthy adult in the
contralateral lower limb. [Subjects] The subjects were 40 healthy adults (35 males and 5
females). [Methods] The muscle activity of the rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris,
anterior tibialis, and medial gastrocnemius (MG) of the contralateral lower limb was
measured using electromyography while the subjects flexed, extended, abducted, and
adducted the shoulder joint of an upper limb. [Results] The muscle activity of the RF of
the contralateral lower limb was significantly high when the subject flexed the shoulder
joint of an upper limb, and the muscle activity of the MG of the contralateral lower limb
was significantly high when the subject adducted the shoulder joint of an upper limb.
[Conclusion] The isometric contraction that results from flexion and adduction of the
shoulder joint of an upper limb in a supine position is considered to selectively affect
the RF and MG activity of the contralateral lower limb.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd><kwd>Isometric contraction</kwd><kwd>Contralateral lower extremity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In general, different direct therapeutic approaches have been used as exercise treatment
methods for the neurological forms of some conditions to improve the functions of the
affected side; however, indirect therapeutic approaches aimed at helping the affected side
recover using the body parts on the unaffected side have also been said to be effective<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. With regard to indirect treatment,
Hellebrandt et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that maximal
exercise of the unilateral limbs triggered muscle tone in the contralateral body part
without exercise and that the flexion pattern of the upper limb accompanying contraction of
the abdominal muscles indirectly activated the trunk muscles. In addition, Devine et
al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that contralateral
exercise was conducive to reducing muscular atrophy, maintaining motor coordination, and
enhancing the muscle strength of damaged lower extremities, and therapists were able to
improve the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with neuromuscular system diseases and
musculoskeletal problems. In the clinical field, the application of indirect treatment is
explained by the concept of cross education, and it is now being supported by research, as
research results indicated that training on the unaffected side influences the functions of
the affected side<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using electromyography (EMG), Shima et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> verified that resistance training on one side triggered
changes in muscle strength on the opposite side, and Bemben and Murphy<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that short-term unilateral side resistance training
resulted in increased muscle strength in the untrained extremities. Therefore, indirect
treatment using cross education has been proposed as a method to help patients with
hemiparesis, patients who have undergone hip or knee joint replacement, and patients with
plaster fixation of the unilateral limbs for muscular and functional recovery of the paretic
side<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prior studies have noted that
muscle training with the paretic side lower limb increased the muscle strength of the
contralateral lower limb<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, but other studies did not
obtain such effects<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As in previous studies, it is difficult to examine precise and detailed changes in the
muscle activity of the lower extremities using EMG, and Korean studies that look at the
muscle activity of the contralateral lower limb through isometric contraction of an upper
limb are lacking, and there are conflicting opinions about the effects of indirect
treatment. Accordingly, this study was conducted to examine changes the lower-limb muscle
activity of healthy subjects based on the movement of the upper limbs. Its aim was to
examine the muscle activity of the contralateral lower limb according to isometric
contraction of an upper limb in a supine position and to suggest an efficient means of upper
limb movement with the aim of increasing the contraction of the contralateral lower limb
muscles, thereby presenting basic data for rehabilitation treatment of early hemiplegic
patients who have difficulty with physical postural control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 healthy adults (35 males, 5 females) in their 20s who
were undergraduates at Y University, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea. Their average
age, weight, and height were 21.6&#x02005;years old, 68.6 kg, and 174.4&#x02005;cm, respectively. Prior to
the experiment, the subjects were informed about the purpose of this study and exercise
method, and they voluntarily consented to participate in this experiment and signed an
agreement according to the ethical Standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Those who had
received muscle strengthen training in the previous six months or who had orthopedic or
neurological damage were excluded.</p><p>The subjects lay in a supine position, spread their legs shoulder-width apart, placed their
toes in a neutral position, and maintained an anatomical position for initiation of the
exercise. Muscle activity was recorded while the subjects conducted isometric contraction,
flexing the shoulder joint at 20&#x02005;cm from the ground for flexion, extension, abduction, and
adduction of the shoulder joint. All the subjects conducted isometric flexion, extension,
abduction, and adduction of the shoulder joint using the dominant side upper extremity, to
ensure consistency in the experimental method, and the muscle activity of the rectus femoris
(RF), biceps femoris (BF), anterior tibialis (AT), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) was
recorded. The four kinds of shoulder joint exercise conditions were randomly applied to the
subjects.</p><p>To provide the same adequate resistance for all subjects, a handheld dynamometer was used.
Resistance was applied to the proximal part of the front, back, medial, and lateral parts of
the arm while the subjects conducted isometric flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction
of the shoulder joint. Visual feedback was provided to the patients and the evaluator with
the handheld dynamometer, so constant resistance against the subjects could be continuously
maintained for five seconds. During the measurements, the extension of the elbow joint was
maintained, and when other compensation appeared, another measurement was taken. The
subjects rested for one minute between exercises. They performed conducted contraction for
five seconds and repeated it three times. The average value of the three measurements was
used for the final analysis. The maximal isometric contraction of each upper extremity
movement was obtained using the handheld dynamometer (Commander&#x02122;, JTECH Medical, Salt Lake
City, UT, USA) to provide the same appropriate resistance, and resistance was provided to
maintain 50% of the maximal contractility<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Surface EMG (MP150, BIOPAC Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was employed to measure
changes in muscle activity, and surface electrodes were attached to the RF, BF, AT, and MG.
EMG signals were sent to the MP150 system and converted into digital signals. Data were
processed using the Acqknowledge software (version 4.01) on a personal computer. The average
value of each subject&#x02019;s EMG signals was expressed as a percentage of the maximal voluntary
isometric contraction.</p><p>In this study, repeated one-way analysis of variance was conducted in order to examine the
muscle activity of the contralateral lower limb following isometric contraction of the upper
limb, and the Bonferroni method was used as a post hoc test. The data for this study were
statistically processed using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The significance level was set at &#x003b1; =
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the study results, the muscle activity of the RF of the contralateral lower

muscle activity of contralateral the opposite side lower extremity in a healthy adult, this
study measured the muscle activity of the RF, BF, AT, and MG of the contralateral site lower
extremity in response to flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the shoulder joint
of the an upper extremity.</p><p>Tarnanen et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the trunk
muscle activity of the same and opposite sides in response to isometric contraction of one
upper extremities, and they reported that the activity of the multifidus muscle of both the
same and opposite sides increased during the horizontal abduction of the shoulder joint. In
a study of the activity of the spinal erector muscle when subjects supported a weight loaded
on the upper extremities in a standing position, Crommert et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the activity of the muscle increased more when
the subjects supported the loaded weight by horizontally extending the arms at the height of
the knee joint than when they supported the loaded weight without horizontally extending the
arms, and they asserted that the location of the resistance loaded on the extremities
significantly affected the activity of the spinal extensor muscle. Park et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that isometric contraction of the
hip joint on one side may increase the trunk muscle activity on the opposite side and that
the isometric contraction in flexion and abduction of the hip joint on one side influenced
the relative activity of the muscles, such as the multifidus muscle engaging in trunk
postural control. In a study of patients with a fixed lower extremity resulting from damage
it had suffered, Arai et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that exercise of the contralateral lower extremity comprised of proprioceptive neuromuscular
facilitation exercises increased the contractility of the affected side quadriceps femoris
muscle more than ordinary exercise consisting of diverse resistance exercises. Sato and
Maruyama<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that, among the
techniques of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) when isometric resistance
exercises were performed by an upper extremity in the final position of the
flexion-abduction-external rotation pattern of PNF, the extension force of the lower
extremity on the opposite side increased. Yoo et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that during unilateral lower-limb PNF pattern training,
abdominal hollowing significantly increased the muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, the
tibialis anterior, the semitendinosus, and the gastrocnemius of contralateral lower
extremity.</p><p>According to the results of the present study, when the subjects flexed the shoulder joint
of an upper extremity, the muscle activity of the RF of the contralateral lower extremity
was significantly high, and when the subjects adducted the shoulder joint of an upper
extremity, the muscle activity of the MG of the contralateral lower extremity was
significantly high. Regarding this result, Myers et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> explained that the human body responded as a whole when one part of
the body moved, and the only tissue that could perform functional intervention was the
connective tissue; they approached the interactions and the overall functions of different
physical systems through the concept of lines, and they expressed interactions using front,
back, lateral, arm, spinal, and oblique lines. As for the functional connectivity between
the upper extremity and contralateral opposite side lower extremity applied in the present
study, flexion and adduction of the shoulder joint of an upper extremity led to high muscle
activity in the RF and the MG due to anatomical connectivity between the arm line of the
upper extremity and the spinal line, according to the lines proposed by Myers et al<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, it is difficult to discuss long-term
treatment effects with the present study results because isometric contraction of the upper
extremity was conducted for a relatively short period of time. Therefore, long-term research
is necessary. Second, the possibility of latent signals occurring during surface EMG due to
other nearby soft tissues cannot be excluded because of the characteristics of the
measurement method. Third, the muscle activity was measured with subjects in a supine
position only, and the muscle activity according to different postures and locations was ont
considered. Thus, future research should examine how isometric contraction of an upper
extremity according to different postures and locations influences the muscle activity of
healthy adults in the lower extremity on the opposite side.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name></person-group>: Neurological physical therapy.
