However, the angiogenesis that occurs during bone formation is often overlooked in scaffold design. In this novel study, we incorporated two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), ie, small interfering RNA targets casein kinase 2 interaction protein 1 (siCkip-1) and small interfering RNA targets soluble VEGF receptor 1 (siFlt-1), which can promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis, into a chitosan sponge. This scaffold could maintain siRNAs for over 2 weeks in neutral phosphate-buffered saline and degraded rapidly in the presence of lysozyme. The chitosan sponge with siCkip-1 and siFlt-1 in vitro bioactivity was investigated using mesenchymal stem cells. Target genes were significantly suppressed, and osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and vascular endothelial growth factor were significantly upregulated. Alizarin Red staining revealed that mineralization of the extracellular matrix was markedly enhanced by dual transfection. Further analysis by immunofluorescence confirmed that the siRNA-modified scaffold simultaneously improved the expression of osteocalcin and von Willebrand factor. In vivo testing in a skull critical-size defect model showed marked bone regeneration in rats treated with siCkip-1 and siFlt-1. In conclusion, chitosan sponge containing osteogenic and angiogenic siRNAs may be used as a scaffold for bone regeneration. The dual siRNA concept may also be useful in the biofunctionalization of other materials.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>chitosan sponge</kwd><kwd>osteogenesis</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>small interfering RNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Defective bone can be a challenging problem in a number of settings, including trauma, deformity, infection, and cancer.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although the host may have the ability to recover, bone substitutes or grafts are required when the defects are larger than a critical size.<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Conventional efforts to improve the osteogenic potency of bone scaffolds have focused mainly on immobilizing growth factors to facilitate anabolic metabolism.<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Traditional tissue engineering scaffold-based implant materials focus mainly on effective and efficient osteogenesis; however, angiogenesis is another mandatory event during formation of bone that is often neglected in scaffold design. Angiogenesis and osteogenesis both require a blood supply that provides a sustentacular niche for self-renewing osteoprogenitor cells and cytokines such as hypoxia inducible factor 1<xref rid="b7-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> during bone formation.<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis is regulated by a specific vessel subtype in bone.<xref rid="b10-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Consequently, an active blood vessel network is a prerequisite for bone regeneration.

Therefore, we hypothesize that incorporation of siRNAs that simultaneously promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis into the scaffold may solve the problem at the gene expression level during bone regeneration. Each type of siRNA has a clear specific target and the effect would be more precise and predictable compared with degradation of mRNA. Targeted knockdown of casein kinase 2 interacting protein 1 (Ckip-1) markedly improves the bone phenotype both in vitro and in vivo via the bone morphogenetic protein-related signaling pathway.<xref rid="b16-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Meanwhile, downregulation of soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1) induces angiogenesis by release of additional free VEGF.<xref rid="b17-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, we delivered these two siRNAs simultaneously with the aim of promoting anabolic metabolism in defective bone.</p><p>A chitosan sponge was used as a scaffold to maintain and deliver the dual siRNAs.

The internalization efficiency was further confirmed by flow cytometry. The sponge loaded with dual siRNAs showed at least a 5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in both the red and green channels when compared with controls, which was similar to the counter mono siRNA internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-5307">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>RT-qPCR analysis</title><p>Relative gene expression was monitored by RT-qPCR.

Due to the silencing of Ckip-1, mRNA for alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin increased by ~2.5-fold in the dual transfection group and by ~2-fold in the mono siCkip-1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5307">Figure 5A</xref>).

One week later, the target genes recovered to ~50% in the sponge containing the dual siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5307">Figure 5B</xref>). Alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin increased by ~5.5-fold in the dual transfection group and by ~3.5-fold in the mono siCkip-1 transfection group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5307">Figure 5B</xref>). Meanwhile, VEGF increased by ~5-fold in the dual transfection group and by ~4.5-fold in the mono siFlt-1 transfection group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5307">Figure 5B</xref>).

In addition, the novel vascularization protein, von Willebrand factor, was also markedly enhanced on the dual siRNA-modified scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-5307">Figure 6</xref>).

Mono siCkip-1 transfection could also increase new bone formation when compared with the siNC or blank sponge.

The sectioned sample was stained according to Van Gieson&#x02019;s protocol after ultrahard slicing.

These two siRNAs could be maintained in this scaffold for over 2 weeks and were able to colocate around seeded MSCs.

Chitosan is an inexpensive and nontoxic polymer which has been extensively used as a drug carrier system.<xref rid="b21-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Chitosan sponge is a porous and plastic material compared with solid bone substitutes, so it is favorable for both drug loading and irregular bone defects restoration. Therefore, it may be more suitable for craniomaxillofacial defects regeneration since most of the bones here are curved and complicated.<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In addition, chitosan sponge can be synthesized without additional reagents that could have unwanted effects. For these reasons, chitosan sponge was used as both a drug reservoir and regeneration material in our study.</p><p>Chitosan sponge has been used as a carrier enabling sustained drug release.<xref rid="b21-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Our results confirmed that two siRNAs can have a superimposed action when cotransfected into MSCs from the sponge. In the surface characterization study, numerous Lipofectamine/siRNA particles aggregated together after lyophilization;<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> however, the particles behaved very differently when compared with those from the direct measurement from aqueous solution.<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This aggregation might possibly be ascribed to the use of a lyophilization process without nonionic lyoprotectants.<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The siRNA release from the sponge could persist for a relatively long duration, which could probably acquire prolonged gene silence effect. In addition, the RT-qPCR data showed that the target genes were suppressed for at least 1 week. The growth rates of MSCs in the sponge + siCkip-1, siFlt-1, and sponge + siNC groups were not significantly different; however, both of them significantly lower than the sponge alone, indicating that the suppression may have originated from Lipofectamine and it was considered as its main drawback.<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Colocalization observed by fluorescence microscope and quantitative data with flow cytometer assay showed high transfection efficiency in MSCs, which is in agreement with a previous report,<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and suggests that Lipofectamine could be used to deliver two siRNAs simultaneously.

Therefore, knockdown of Ckip-1 or sFlt-1 alone was able to increase the expression of osteogenic genes and new bone regeneration to some degree. However, when they were delivered together, osteogenic differentiation was markedly improved both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the angiogenic effect of siFlt-1 could further enhance the osteogenic effect of siCkip-1. Taken together, manipulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously during bone tissue engineering may provide a more powerful efficiency.<xref rid="b28-ijn-9-5307" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>siRNA-modified chitosan sponges could maintain siRNA for a longer term without losing its efficacy. Chitosan sponges loaded with both siCkip-1 and siFlt-1 had superimposed activity, resulting in a high degree of colocalization with cells and simultaneous enhancement of both osteogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that this scaffold is able to promote new bone regeneration. This dual siRNA-modified chitosan scaffold could potentially be used for restoration of healthy bone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ijn-9-5307"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wiese</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pape</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone defects caused by high-energy injuries, bone loss, infected nonunions, and nonunions</article-title><source>Orthop Clin North Am</source><year>2010</year><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19931047</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ijn-9-5307"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nishida</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Shimamura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Methods of reconstruction for bone defect after tumor excision: a review of alternatives</article-title><source>Med Sci Monit</source><year>2008</year><volume>14</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>RA107</fpage><lpage>RA113</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18668007</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ijn-9-5307"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ueda</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Oba</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Omiya</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Okada</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cranial-bone defects with depression deformity treated with ceramic implants and free-flap transfers</article-title><source>Br J Plast Surg</source><year>2001</year><volume>54</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>403</fpage><lpage>408</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11428771</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ijn-9-5307"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gomes</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rodent models in bone-related research: the relevance of calvarial defects in the assessment of bone regeneration strategies</article-title><source>Lab Anim</source><year>2011</year><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>14</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21156759</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ijn-9-5307"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berner</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Boerckel</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Saifzadeh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Biomimetic tubular nanofiber mesh and platelet rich plasma-mediated delivery of BMP-7 for large bone defect regeneration</article-title><source>Cell Tissue Res</source><year>2012</year><volume>347</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>603</fpage><lpage>612</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22277992</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-ijn-9-5307"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Joung</surname><given-names>YK</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 from nanocomplex incorporated on hydroxyapatite-formed titanium surface</article-title><source>J Control Release</source><year>2012</year><volume>160</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>676</fpage><lpage>684</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22543042</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b7-ijn-9-5307"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mamalis</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cochran</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The therapeutic potential of oxygen tension manipulation via hypoxia inducible factors and mimicking agents in guided bone regeneration.
