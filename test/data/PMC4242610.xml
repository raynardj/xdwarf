In barley, previous heading time studies have been mainly conducted under field conditions to measure total days to heading. We followed a novel approach and studied the natural variation of time to heading in a world-wide spring barley collection (218 accessions), comprising of 95 photoperiod-sensitive (<italic>Ppd-H1</italic>) and 123 accessions with reduced photoperiod sensitivity (<italic>ppd-H1</italic>) to long-day (LD) through dissecting pre-anthesis development into four major stages and sub-phases. The study was conducted under greenhouse (GH) conditions (LD; 16/8 h; &#x0223c;20/&#x0223c;16&#x000b0;C day/night). Genotyping was performed using a genome-wide high density 9K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chip which assayed 7842 SNPs. We used the barley physical map to identify candidate genes underlying genome-wide association scans (GWAS). GWAS for pre-anthesis stages/sub-phases in each photoperiod group provided great power for partitioning genetic effects on floral initiation and heading time. In addition to major genes known to regulate heading time under field conditions, several novel QTL with medium to high effects, including new QTL having major effects on developmental stages/sub-phases were found to be associated in this study. For example, highly associated SNPs tagged the physical regions around <italic>HvCO1</italic> (barley <italic>CONSTANS1</italic>) and <italic>BFL</italic> (<italic>BARLEY FLORICAULA</italic>/<italic>LEAFY</italic>) genes. Based upon our GWAS analysis, we propose a new genetic network model for each photoperiod group, which includes several newly identified genes, such as several <italic>HvCO-like</italic> genes, belonging to different heading time pathways in barley.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was financially supported from DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant number SCHN 768/4-1, and BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) GABI-FUTURE Start Program grant number 0315071 to TS.

Its complex genetic architecture was considered as one of the major breeding goals during last century. The capacity to regulate heading time provides crop plants with the opportunity to successfully complete their life cycle under a wide range of environments, which exceed the distribution range of their wild relatives <xref rid="pone.0113120-Andres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The optimal time to flower is crucial for high crop grain yields <xref rid="pone.0113120-Purugganan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For decades, studies on heading/flowering time solely focused on the total number of days until heading/flowering and its effect on grain yield in response to environmental cues. However, the time prior to anthesis (i.e. pre-anthesis developmental phases) in barley consists of vegetative, early and late reproductive phases <xref rid="pone.0113120-Alqudah1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-Sreenivasulu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Grain yield and yield potential are significantly influenced by the reproductive, pre-anthesis phase durations <xref rid="pone.0113120-Borrs1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which were shown to be genetically controlled <xref rid="pone.0113120-Alqudah1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Despite the importance of this earlier phase of development, most of what we know about the genetic control of pre-anthesis phases is purely based on traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, wherein often vegetative and reproductive phases were not clearly separable <xref rid="pone.0113120-BorrsGelonch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-BorrsGelonch2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Alqudah and Schnurbusch <xref rid="pone.0113120-Alqudah1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> proposed an amended approach for dissecting the longest pre-anthesis phase (late-reproductive phase) into three sub-phases: awn primordium (AP) to tipping (TIP); TIP to heading (HD); HD to anther extrusion (AE). This refined approach, based upon clearly defined developmental pre-anthesis stages, might shed more light on the causal genetic factors responsible for the variation in developmental stages/sub-phases in response to photoperiod in barley.</p><p>Most studies in barley aimed to unravel the genetics of heading time and the underlying specific genes in response to photoperiod, vernalization and/or earliness per se. The first two factors change heading time in response to environmental conditions, while the last factor determines heading time independent of photoperiod and temperature <xref rid="pone.0113120-Bullrich1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In barley, a long-day (LD) crop, the <italic>PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR</italic> (<italic>HvPRR37</italic>) gene, also known as <italic>PHOTOPERIOD RESPONSE LOCUS1</italic> (<italic>Ppd-H1</italic>), is the central heading time gene regulated in responses to LD, at which recessive alleles (<italic>ppd-H1</italic>) reduce the response to LD <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Variation at <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> affects heading time of accessions originating from different geographical regions. Spring barley accessions originating from Middle East, e.g. tend to carry photoperiod responsive <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> alleles, causing early heading under LD, while the delay of heading time in Northern European accessions of spring barley is due to reduced photoperiod sensitivity, <italic>ppd-H1</italic>, alleles <xref rid="pone.0113120-Andres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, strength of photoperiod response is a key factor to understand the natural genetic variation and pathway of heading time in barley.</p><p>In addition to the <italic>HvPRR</italic>37 gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 2H <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, further genes of the heading time pathway have been identified in barley. <italic>Ppd-H2</italic>, responsive to short-day (SD) is located on 1HL, for which <italic>HvFT3</italic> has been proposed as a candidate gene <xref rid="pone.0113120-Faure1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Five <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>-like; <italic>HvFT1-HvFT5</italic>) genes were found in barley, and these genes play various roles during plant development through their photoperiod response, of which <italic>HvFT1</italic> has a major role in the transition from the vegetative-to-reproductive phase as an important source of variation in heading time <xref rid="pone.0113120-Faure1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, the <italic>CONSTANS</italic>-like (<italic>CO</italic>) gene family is known to regulate flowering time through the photoperiod pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (a LD plant) and rice (SD plant). In barley, Griffiths et al. <xref rid="pone.0113120-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and Cockram et al. <xref rid="pone.0113120-Cockram1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> identified numerous homologs of <italic>CO</italic>-like genes (<italic>HvCO1</italic> to <italic>HvCO18</italic>) but their roles in the barley heading time pathway are still unclear. <italic>GIGANTEA (GI)</italic>-<italic>CO</italic>-<italic>FT</italic> is considered as a conserved central interaction partner in plant photoperiod pathway under LD, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113120-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; however, the function of <italic>HvGI</italic> in the barley photoperiod pathway is still unclear. CCT domain gene families (CO, CO-LIKE, TIMING OF CAB1 (TOC1)), i.e. <italic>CO</italic>-like and <italic>PRR</italic>, have an important role in controlling heading time; in addition to these families <xref rid="pone.0113120-Cockram1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> introduced uncharacterized genes carrying single CCT domains called <italic>CCT MOTIF FAMILY</italic> (<italic>CMF</italic>) genes. <italic>PHYTOCHROME</italic> (<italic>HvPhy</italic>) and <italic>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED</italic> (<italic>HvCCA</italic>) genes clearly affect barley heading time pathway through interaction with other genes, such as <italic>HvPhyC</italic> which induces early heading by up-regulating <italic>HvFT1</italic> and bypassing <italic>HvCO1</italic> under LD <xref rid="pone.0113120-Nishida1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL</italic> (<italic>LHY</italic>) and <italic>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1</italic> (<italic>CCA1</italic>) suppress <italic>FT</italic> expression independent of the <italic>CO</italic> causing delayed flowering <xref rid="pone.0113120-Fujiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Similarly, <italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</italic>-like (<italic>SVP</italic>-like) genes such as <italic>VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION gene2</italic> (<italic>HvVRT2</italic>) in barley delayed heading time by inhibiting spike development under LD <xref rid="pone.0113120-Trevaskis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. <italic>RICE FLORICAULA/LEAFY</italic> (i.e. <italic>RFL</italic>; syn. <italic>ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION2</italic>, <italic>APO2</italic>) is the homolog of <italic>Arabidopsis LEAFY</italic> and plays important roles in regulating the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, maintenance of inflorescence meristem, floral organ identity/determinacy and flowering time in rice <xref rid="pone.0113120-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-IkedaKawakatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>LFY</italic> acts downstream of <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1</italic>, (<italic>SOC1</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0113120-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; whereas <italic>RFL</italic> functions upstream of <italic>OsSOC1</italic> and reduced expression of <italic>RFL</italic> delayed flowering time in rice <xref rid="pone.0113120-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. With regard to genes that are involved in responses to vernalization, <italic>Vrn-H1</italic> located on 5HL (promotes transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase) is dominant in spring barley <xref rid="pone.0113120-Hemming1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, while <italic>Vrn-H2</italic> (<italic>HvZCCT</italic>) located on 4HL delays heading in plants that have not been vernalized <xref rid="pone.0113120-Karsai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; it similarly delays heading time under LD <xref rid="pone.0113120-Casao1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic>Vrn-H3</italic> (syn. <italic>HvFT1</italic>), a central integrator of different heading time pathways, had been identified on 7HS <xref rid="pone.0113120-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, many independent <italic>EARLINESS PER SE</italic> (<italic>EPS</italic>) and <italic>EARLY MATURITY</italic> (<italic>EAM</italic>) loci have been identified in barley: <italic>eps2S</italic> (<italic>eam6</italic>) on 2HS, <italic>eps3L</italic> (<italic>eam10</italic>) on 3HL, <italic>eps4L</italic> on 4HL, <italic>eps5L</italic> on 5HL, <italic>eps6L.1</italic> and <italic>eps6L.2</italic> on 6HL, <italic>eps7S</italic> on 7HS and <italic>eps7L</italic> on 7HL <xref rid="pone.0113120-Laurie1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The precise position of these genes in coherent barley heading time pathway is not yet understood.</p><p>High-throughput genotyping platforms recently developed in barley provide sufficient marker coverage to perform genome-wide association scans (GWAS) <xref rid="pone.0113120-Waugh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. GWAS is a powerful tool for mapping complex plant traits, with unprecedented genetic resolution for gene identification in large-genome crops such as barley and wheat. GWAS can identify genes responsible for natural phenotypic variation through screening a large, diverse collection of accessions with high density genetic markers to find causal genes as a result of historical recombination <xref rid="pone.0113120-Waugh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In barley, GWAS has been used to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with heading time <xref rid="pone.0113120-Pasam1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-Comadran1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, information on the genetic variation of pre-anthesis stages/sub-phases as key components of barley adaptation and grain yield is still lacking.</p><p>The aim of this study is to detect QTL underlying natural variation of pre-anthesis stages/sub-phases based upon differences in photoperiod response (<italic>Ppd-H1</italic>/<italic>ppd-H1</italic>) through dissecting time to heading into sub-phases in a world-wide spring barley collection. To achieve this objective, we phenotyped more than 3,000 plants at four developmental stages (AP, TIP, HD and AE) under controlled GH conditions, derived from 95 photoperiod responsive (<italic>Ppd-H1</italic>) and 123 accessions with reduced photoperiod sensitivity (i.e. <italic>ppd-H1</italic>), respectively. Distinction of these two photoperiod groups in our GWAS analysis allowed us to control population structure, while using a 9K SNP chip provided us with an unprecedented genetic resolution for studying the natural variation of time to heading. In combination with accurate phenotyping of pre-anthesis stages into sub-phases (i.e. sowing to AP, includes vegetative and early reproductive phases; AP-TIP; TIP-HD and HD-AE) within each photoperiod group, natural genetic variation of the time to heading could be genetically dissected resulting in the identification of novel QTL that were anchored to the barley physical map (e.g. several associations around <italic>HvCO</italic>-like genes). Clearly, novel rich genomic regions with highly associated SNPs were detected, which have not been detected before. This paper proposes a new heading-time model for barley with specific reference to allelic combinations to photoperiod-response groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The collection, genotyping and population structure</title><p>A collection of 218 world-wide spring barley accessions was used in this study.

Among these regions, the highly associated SNPs around <italic>HvCO14</italic>, <italic>HvCO2</italic> and <italic>HvCO11</italic> (6HL, 67.9&#x02013;69.3 cM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g006">Figure 6</xref>) showed the strongest phenotypic effect on the time from AP to TIP (-80 GDD) and occurred exclusively in this group. GWAS analysis of the time to TIP identified thirty significant associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The time to TIP can be seen as an integrator of the two sub-phases sowing-AP and AP-TIP. Hence, it is not surprising that many associations overlap with AP, AP-TIP and later stages and sub-phases, indicating that many of these loci affect more than one stage or sub-phase. Nevertheless, we found three chromosomal regions in this group, which had major phenotypic effects on the time to TIP: these were highly associated SNPs around the <italic>Ppd-H2</italic> locus on 1HL (87.8&#x02013;93.1 cM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and two regions on chromosome 5H, containing <italic>HvCO3</italic>, <italic>HvTFL1</italic> and <italic>HvCMF13</italic> (5HS, 43.7&#x02013;51.6 cM) and the <italic>Vrn-H1, HvPhyC</italic> (113.8&#x02013;125.8 cM). The two late sub-phases, i.e. TIP-HD and HD-AE, are relatively short compared with the other two earlier sub-phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g003">Figure 3</xref>); but we were still able to find twenty-five and thirteen significantly associated chromosomal regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As expected, the majority of these loci preferentially co-located with regions being associated with other developmental stages and sub-phases, again reinforcing the fact that a high degree of pleiotropic gene actions exists between several stages and sub-phases.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Identification of marker-trait association within the <italic>ppd-H1</italic>-carrying group</title><p>All 123 accessions in this group carry the <italic>ppd-H1</italic> allele with reduced photoperiod sensitivity and thus reach most stages/sub-phases significantly later under LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g003">Figure 3</xref>). GWAS analysis in this group identified in total at least twenty significantly associated chromosomal regions of which only seven were group-specific, indicating that <italic>ppd-H1</italic>-accessions display a much less complex genetic architecture for pre-anthesis development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Among those regions, most highly associated SNPs around <italic>HvCO1</italic> (7HS, 67.6&#x02013;73.4 cM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g007">Figure 7</xref>) resulted in the major phenotypic effect in this group. However, <italic>HvCO1</italic> resides in a chromosomal region, which physically contains three other <italic>CO</italic>-like family members (<italic>HvCO12</italic>, <italic>HvCO13/HvM</italic> and <italic>HvCO15</italic>) and the circadian clock-related genes, <italic>HvLHY</italic>/<italic>HvCCA1</italic>. Nevertheless, specific associations could be found for several physically anchored and co-located SNPs for each of the genes therefore making it possible to attribute phenotypic effects to individual genes. Hence, the most significant effects were found for SNPs co-locating with <italic>HvCO1</italic> for the time between AP-TIP***, time to TIP***, HD*** and AE* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g007">Figure 7</xref>) thereby shortening duration, i.e. promoting heading, by &#x02212;126, &#x02212;148, &#x02212;172 and &#x02212;153 GDD, respectively. The physically close <italic>HvLHY</italic>, <italic>HvCCA1</italic> region, however, showed up in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g007">7</xref>) a consistent heading time-inhibiting effect (i.e. here in the <italic>ppd-H1</italic> group at TIP +128 and +105 GDD for <italic>HvLHY</italic>, <italic>HvCCA1</italic>, respectively), suggesting that these two tightly linked chromosomal regions on 7HS function reciprocally on <italic>HvFT1</italic> expression. Another very consistent but group-specific effect was obtained from SNPs on 6HS (16.0 cM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g007">Figure 7</xref>), reducing time to TIP* and HD* by &#x02212;151 and &#x02212;173 GDD, respectively.

We compared previously identified heading time-related associations/QTL using the present spring barley collection studied with 957 SNPs <xref rid="pone.0113120-Pasam2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and results from bi-parental populations <xref rid="pone.0113120-BorrsGelonch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-BorrsGelonch2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For heading time, we similarly detected all previously identified QTLs when using the larger SNP array (9K) but most importantly several new QTL underlying pre-anthesis spike development. Compared to previous studies, the power of our GWAS to detect associated loci was increased, likely as a result of better genome coverage and more SNPs. The power of GWAS can be strongly attributed to the <italic>Ppd-H1</italic>-based population structure, which had not been applied before to study natural variation in heading time for barley. This approach provides strong associations, especially when <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> alleles were less active thereby revealing the importance of <italic>HvCO1</italic> as potential candidate gene.

Natural variation around these three loci consistently showed phenotypic effects in our world-wide spring barley collection regardless of photoperiod status but with <italic>Ppd-H2</italic> as the most important locus. Almost all developmental stages and sub-phases were significantly associated with the <italic>Ppd-H2</italic> chromosomal region within the <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> group, clearly indicating that this locus is important in photoperiod-respons and vernalized spring barleys under LD.

No allelic variation within the <italic>ppd-H1</italic>-carrying group occurs at <italic>Vrn-H1</italic>, <italic>HvPhyC</italic> rather suggesting selection for late-heading time alleles within this group.

Allelic variation around <italic>BFL</italic> appears as the first report for temperate cereals that this important phase-transition-gene is relevant in both photoperiod groups. Postulating a similar role for <italic>BFL</italic> in rice <xref rid="pone.0113120-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, heading time control is very likely promoted particularly in the earlier heading and <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> group through a combination of allelic variation found at <italic>HvSOC1</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0113120-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g009">Figure 9</xref>). However, we did not find any associations for <italic>HvSOC1</italic> within the <italic>ppd-H1</italic> group; this might be explainable through the fixation of only one allele-type. In rice, higher transcript levels of <italic>RFL</italic> had been causal for early flowering <xref rid="pone.0113120-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Later heading time of the <italic>ppd-H1</italic> accessions suggests that <italic>BFL</italic> transcript levels may be lowered in this group, thereby resulting in an extended AP-TIP period. Thus, <italic>BFL</italic> appears to be an important gene affecting late sub-phase duration, especially in <italic>ppd-H1</italic>. Significant SNPs around <italic>HvCEN</italic> also became detectable in both groups, indicating that the heading time delaying effect of this gene (<italic>Ppd-H1</italic>: +60 GDD; <italic>ppd-H1</italic>: +138 GDD) has been manifested in our spring barely collection.

Assuming a very similar haplotype structure at <italic>HvCEN</italic> in our spring barley collection may be sufficient to explain obtained results. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the observed effect has been derived from another physically linked unknown gene, which is in linkage disequilibrium with <italic>HvCEN</italic> in the large centromeric region of chromosome 2H <xref rid="pone.0113120-Comadran1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Barley plants carrying <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> alleles respond to LD conditions through up-regulation of <italic>HvFT1</italic> resulting in early heading <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For this group we found significant association around the <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> locus (i.e. the <italic>HvPRR37</italic> gene) affecting all stages and sub-phases. This finding can mainly be explained through the presence of natural variants around <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> in our collection (Sharma et al. <italic>in preparation</italic>). Similarly, natural variation at <italic>HvFT1</italic> consistently accounted for heading time effects in this group, further corroborating previous findings that natural copy number variation at <italic>HvFT1</italic> contributes towards accelerated heading time in barley <xref rid="pone.0113120-Nitcher1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Overall, we found that the <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> group exhibited a complex genetic constitution for pre-anthesis spike development and final time to heading. One reason for the high degree of complexity in this group is the involvement of 10 genes belonging to the <italic>CO</italic>-like family, which co-located with at least one significant association in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g009">Figure 9</xref>). <italic>CO</italic>-like genes usually regulate heading time by photoperiod in barley <xref rid="pone.0113120-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113120-Cockram1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, in the past it was not possible to specifically assign <italic>CO</italic>-family members to particular photoperiod groups, or to estimate their possible role in a stage or sub-phase dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0113120-Andres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Following our strategy of genetically dissecting pre-anthesis development it becomes possible to specifically relate allelic variation around <italic>CO</italic>-like family members to specific photoperiod groups and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g009">Figure 9</xref>). One important example among <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> accessions is the <italic>CO</italic>-like gene cluster on 6H (<italic>HvCO2</italic>, <italic>CO11</italic>, <italic>CO14</italic>; 67.9&#x02013;69.3 cM) which mainly affects phase durations after AP stage. More detailed SNP analyses suggest that the effect is more closely related to the <italic>HvCO2</italic>-<italic>HvCO11</italic> region; however, future functional work on individual genes is required to show whether one or more genes in this cluster contribute to variation in pre-anthesis development and time to heading. Similar conclusions can be drawn from gene clusters on chromosome 4H, which besides <italic>HvCO16</italic> also includes <italic>HvPRR59</italic>, <italic>HvPhyB</italic> and <italic>HvPRR73</italic> (see 4H: 51.1&#x02013;51.4 cM), 5HS (including <italic>HvCO3</italic>, <italic>HvTFL1</italic>, <italic>HvCMF13</italic>; 43.7&#x02013;51.6 cM) and 1HS (<italic>HvCMF10</italic>; 41.1&#x02013;48.2 cM). Most interestingly, associations found for all of these regions exclusively occurred in the <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> group, indicating that these chromosomal regions harboring <italic>CO</italic>-like and <italic>CMF</italic> genes may play a major role in adaption for early heading time in barley. Another group-specific effect was found for SNPs around the <italic>FT</italic>-like homolog <italic>HvFT2</italic> and the circadian clock-related gene <italic>HvGI</italic> (3HS: 45.8&#x02013;52.0 cM) both promoting time to heading. <italic>HvGI</italic> was detected with minor effect, supporting the notion by Dunford et al. <xref rid="pone.0113120-Dunford1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> that <italic>HvGI</italic> does not provide a major source of adaptive variation in photoperiod response. Nevertheless, we assume that <italic>HvGI</italic> may have an important role in this group by promoting pre-anthesis spike development through the conserved <italic>GI-CO-FT</italic> pathway <xref rid="pone.0113120-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest a central role of <italic>HvCO-like</italic> genes in the early heading time pathway under LD in photoperiod responsive spring barley accessions. We noted that some of the associations identified in this group are of minor effect with <italic>P</italic>-values just passing significant thresholds, which are more likely affected by variation in response to LD, gene interaction and/or geographical origin effect. Compared to previous studies, controlled GH conditions in conjunction with the novel pre-anthesis dissection approach and high-resolution physical map information draws a much more refined picture of natural adaption to photoperiod in barley.</p><p>Less active alleles of <italic>HvPRR37</italic> (i.e. <italic>ppd-H1</italic>) delay heading time under LD by reduced apex and spike development <xref rid="pone.0113120-Hemming1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, at which <italic>ppd-H1</italic> alleles mainly alter expression levels of <italic>HvCO1</italic> as a result of changed circadian timing <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this study, the highly significant effect of <italic>HvCO1</italic> on pre-anthesis spike development and time to heading was markedly associated only within the <italic>ppd-H1</italic> group. Although its genetic position strongly suggests that the strongest associations reside very close to <italic>HvCO1</italic> (supported by 13 SNP markers; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g009">Figure 9</xref>), we cannot completely rule out that linkage with other <italic>CO</italic> genes in this region like <italic>HvCO12, HvCO13/HvM</italic> and <italic>HvCO15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113120-g007">Figure 7</xref>) contribute to this effect. Natural variation around this gene possibly provides the genetic basis for a large portion of the observed differences in pre-anthesis development within this late-heading group (<italic>ppd-H1</italic>). Following conclusions by Turner et al. <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, it can be anticipated that early-heading in this group is most likely coupled with higher <italic>HvCO1</italic> transcript abundance, thus promoting heading. To verify this hypothesis future work is needed to test structural and functional differences at this locus. Among other highly significant group-specific regions the association for promoting heading on 6HS (16.0 cM) stood out. Previous work identified that the <italic>eam7</italic> mutant phenotype had been linked to a region on 6HS, now establishing this position as a candidate for this mutant <xref rid="pone.0113120-Stracke1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Moreover, we found three important chromosomal regions on 2H (107.3&#x02013;112.0 cM), 3HL (122.6&#x02013;126.7 cM) and 5HL (83.5&#x02013;85.6 cM), which showed group-specific associations but did not co-locate with known candidate genes. The 3HL region is approximately. 30 cM proximal to the known circadian clock-related <italic>HvLUX</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0113120-Gawronski1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. More future work is required to validate this association.</p><p>The number of fewer but more significant associations identified in this group (i.e. <italic>ppd-H1</italic>) could be due to the fixation of heading time alleles, or due to the larger number of accessions used in this group (123) and/or longer duration of developmental stages. Only highly significant association around <italic>Ppd-H2</italic>, <italic>HvCO1</italic> and <italic>BFL</italic> genes promote heading within this group. This suggests that within this group the genetic architecture of heading time is less complex and that three genes play a major role on heading time compared to several genes in the <italic>Ppd-H1</italic> group. Another argument could be that within the <italic>ppd-H1</italic>-group <italic>Ppd-H2</italic> might have taken over the effect of <italic>PpdH-1</italic>, and <italic>HvCO1</italic> substitutes the <italic>CO</italic>-family gene effect of other <italic>CO</italic> genes.</p><p>In summary, around 75% of the <italic>ppd-H1</italic> accessions in this study originate from EU. EU spring barley accessions mainly carry <italic>ppd-H1</italic> alleles <xref rid="pone.0113120-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, thus leading to elongated post-AP phase durations due to the reduced response to LD. The collection used in this study, however, includes world-wide spring barley accessions which possess different genetic backgrounds, and hence, can easily explain the detected natural variation of heading time within this group. These results reinforce the importance of <italic>CO-</italic>like genes, specifically <italic>HvCO1</italic>, in the late-heading time pathway (<italic>ppd-H1</italic>) under LD.</p><p>Functional validation of candidate associations found in this work will help to complete our knowledge about developmental stages/sub-phase and/or heading time genetic networks in the future. Studying pre-anthesis development under GH and/or field conditions will greatly aid in the detection of causal variants in small grain cereals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113120.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
