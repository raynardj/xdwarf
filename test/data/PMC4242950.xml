postural control in hemiplegia after stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-four inpatients
with hemiparesis after first-onset stroke were included in this study. We measured the
center of pressure fluctuations during quiet standing using a force platform at 2, 4, and
6 weeks after admission. We assessed weight-bearing asymmetry, and velocity and amplitude
of body sway. [Results] Weight-bearing asymmetry diminished in the first 2 weeks of
observation. Velocity of body sway also decreased significantly in the first 2 weeks,
though its amplitude only decreased significantly after 4 weeks of observation.
[Conclusion] Amplitude of body sway requires a longer time for significant improvement
than weight-bearing asymmetry and velocity of body sway. Although the loading function of
the paretic lower limb improved at an early stage, attainment of optimum postural control,
including management of the affected paretic lower limb, requires much time.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Recovery of function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postural control involves controlling the body&#x02019;s position in space for the dual purpose of
stability and orientation. Postural orientation is defined as the ability to maintain an
appropriate relationship between the body segments and between the body and the environment
for a task. Postural stability, or balance, is the ability to maintain the body in
equilibrium<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural control is often
impaired after stroke. We focused on postural control during quiet standing in this study.
Quiet standing postures of hemiplegics after stroke are characterized by weight-bearing
asymmetry with a shift in the mean position of the center of pressure (COP) toward the
unaffected side<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and an increase of body
sway compared to age-matched healthy controls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Body sway has a negative correlation with
gait velocity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and is related to the risk
of falling<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stable quiet standing supposedly contributes to improved gait ability and the prevention of
falls. Although many researchers have reported on the characteristics of standing postural
control in hemiplegics after stroke, few articles have mentioned the recovery process.
Therefore, we measured the COP fluctuations of hemiplegic stroke patients during quiet
standing using a force platform at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after hospital admission. The subjects
were patients who were admitted to the sub-acute rehabilitation ward at the Fujita Health
University Nanakuri Sanatorium, where we perform intensive rehabilitation for improvement of
paretic function and activities of daily living (ADL). The purpose of this study was to
investigate the recovery process of quiet standing postural control during rehabilitation
treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-four inpatients with hemiplegia after first-onset stroke were included in this

ability to follow instructions and those who had neuromuscular impairment before the onset
of the stroke were excluded from the study. Subjects&#x02019; characteristics at 2 weeks after

Subjects
stood with their arms at their trunk sides and with one foot on each of the two force
plates. The feet were positioned parallel and they were 10&#x02005;cm apart medially. Subjects wore
their own shoes, but did not put on orthoses. Subjects stood with their eyes open and looked
at a target placed at eye level, 2&#x02005;m away. After subjects had stabilized themselves on the
force platform, COP trajectories were measured for 60 seconds at a sampling rate of 20&#x02005;Hz.
Measurements were carried out at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after admission, and progress over the 4
weeks of observation was evaluated.</p><p>Time series of COP were analyzed to define weight-bearing asymmetry, body sway, and
frequency. We investigated mean position (MP) in the mediolateral (M/L) direction, mean
velocity (MV) in the M/L and anteroposterior (A/P) directions, root mean square distance
(RMSD) in the M/L and A/P directions, and power in the M/L and A/P directions based on
frequency analysis.</p><p>The MP in the M/L direction is the mean value of the X axis increments of the COP time
series data, [Equation (1)]. A positive value indicates the unaffected side and a negative
value indicates the paretic side. The MP value in the M/L direction was used in order to
evaluate weight-bearing asymmetry.</p><p>

sway. The International Society of Posturography recommends the use of 2 COP-based measures:
MV and RMSD<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. MV represents the velocity
of body sway and the RMSD is representative of the amplitude of body sway. Because postural
control strategies in the M/L and A/P directions are controlled by different mechanisms<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>,
MV and RMSD were analyzed in both directions. In quiet standing, postural control in the M/L
direction is dominated by a loading/unloading response under the control of the hip
abductors/adductors, and the A/P direction is regulated by synergistic motor patterns of the
ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, the improvement rates of MV and RMSD in the M/L and A/P directions over the 4
weeks period from 2 weeks post-admission were calculated using Equation. (7).</p><p>
<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1761-e007.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula> (7)</p><p>Frequency analysis was also performed to investigate the characteristics of body sway.
Frequency analysis was performed by applying Fast Fourier Transforms to the time-series data
and calculating the power spectrum. The international standard for evaluating the frequency
interval of the power spectrum is 0.02&#x02013;0.2&#x02005;Hz, 0.2&#x02013;2.0&#x02005;Hz, and 2.0&#x02013;10.0&#x02005;Hz<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. We used the power of each frequency band as
a parameter.</p><p>Friedman&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to examine the significance of differences in MP in
the M/L direction, and MV and RMSD in the M/L and A/P directions of COP, among the three
assessment times. When a significant change was found, the Bonfferroni method was used as a
post -hoc test to confirm the significance. The paired t-test was used to compare the
improvement rates of MV and RMSD in the M/L and A/P directions. Significance was accepted for
values of p less than 0.05. All statistical procedures were performed using SPSS version 19.0

of body sway of post-stroke hemiplegic patients in the M/L and A/P directions decreased
significantly in the 4-week period starting 2 weeks after hospital admission. In the
improvement of body sway, the reduction in the M/L direction was larger than that in the A/P
direction. De Haart et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> followed 37
stroke inpatients during their rehabilitation starting from the time they were able to stand
independently for at least 30 seconds, on average 10 weeks post-stroke, and then 2, 4, 8,
and 12 weeks later. They reported that weight-bearing asymmetry diminished in the following
12 weeks, body sway in the M/L and A/P directions decreased gradually over the whole 12
weeks, and body sway in the M/L direction decreased significantly more than that in the A/P
direction. The results of our present study support their findings.</p><p>Reduction of body sway in the M/L direction was larger than that in the A/P direction.
Hemiplegia after stroke causes a large perturbation in body sway in the M/L direction
compared to age-matched healthy controls<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In post-stroke hemiplegia, a shift in the mean position of COP
toward the unaffected side can compensate for the A/P directional perturbation on the
unaffected side, but cannot compensate for the M/L directional perturbation. In other words,
postural control of the M/L direction is strongly affected by paralysis. Therefore,
improvement in the M/L direction reflects improvement in paretic side functions arising from
rehabilitation training.</p><p>This study focused on the recovery process of weight-bearing asymmetry and body sway. Our
results show that weight-bearing asymmetry diminished in the first 2 weeks, but did not
improve thereafter. De Haart et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
also reported that weight-bearing asymmetry diminished in the first 4 weeks, but did not
improve thereafter. In the present study, the loading function of the paretic lower limb
improved and the paretic leg contributed to postural control in the first 2 weeks.
Considering the findings of Hase that overload on the paretic side might cause
overcompensation on the unaffected side<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, the optimum weight-bearing ratio should be the target of early stage
rehabilitation after admission for stroke patients&#x02019; independence in ADL.</p><p>In comparison with the study by De Haart et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, which did not define the characteristics of the recovery process
of body sway, this study showed that the velocity of body sway decreased significantly in
the first 2 weeks of observation, whereas the amplitude decreased significantly over 4
weeks. The timing in improvement was different. The reason for early improvement of velocity
of body sway may be explained by the results of frequency analysis. Body sway of a low
frequency is associated with minimal effort and less stress for maintaining quiet standing
balance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the high frequency
components of body sway reflect activity in response to activation of the graviceptive and
proprioceptive loops<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since a
significant decrease was shown by the high frequency bands (power of 0.2&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;10&#x02005;Hz band) in
the first 2 weeks of observation, sensory feedback from the unaffected side may have
contributed to the early improvement of velocity of body sway. Late improvement of amplitude
of body sway is possibly explained by age-related changes during quiet standing, since
Abrahamova et al. reported that the most sensitive COP parameter for detecting balance
change was RMSD, and RMSD reflects the time taken for integrated processing of sensory
inputs<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the proprioceptive
information from the feet and ankles is artificially altered, normal subjects are compelled
to rely more on other sensory (visual and vestibular) input<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, hemiplegics, who often have visual, vestibular, and
somatosensory disturbance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, have
difficulty in coordinating these inputs, and thus much time is required to improve RMSD by
rehabilitation.</p><p>Despite numerous intervention studies aimed at improving standing postural control, no
definitive conclusion on the best approach to facilitate the recovery of standing postural
control of post-stroke hemiplegia patients has been arrived at<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. One reason for
this is the lack of adequate assessment of standing postural control. A limitation of the
present study was the assessment of only COP. There are many ways of assessing postural
control including COP measurements, as used in this study, alignment research with
kinematics, and assessment of functional improvement in the paretic lower limb using
EMG.</p><p>In conclusion, the amplitude of body sway of post-stroke hemiplegic patients requires a
longer time to show significant improvement than weight-bearing asymmetry and velocity of
body sway. Although the loading on the paretic lower limb improves at an early stage,
attainment of optimum postural control, including management of the affected paretic lower
limb, requires much time. We should emphasize standing training for the paretic lower limb
in accordance with improvement in paretic function to facilitate the recovery of standing
postural control.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Shumway-Cook</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Woolacott</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: Motor Control.
