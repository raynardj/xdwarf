Certain reductions in heart failure rates have been achieved by capping the maximal doses of anthracyclines and by changing their administration schedules. Nevertheless, heart failure continues to affect up to 20% of anthracycline-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The retrospectively identified individual risk factors such as young or old age, female sex, cardiovascular co-morbidities, certain co-therapies, and gene variants are currently of limited help. This is due to the lack of prospective clinical validation and to the scarcity of equipotent anthracycline-free treatment alternatives. Particularly problematic is the high HF risk in anthracycline-treated children and in the elderly attributed, respectively, to the long life expectancy and cardiac co-morbidities.</p><p>The bisdioxopiperazine dexrazoxane (DRZ, ICRF-187) reduces the incidence of anthracycline-induced heart failure by 80% and is the only drug approved for its prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite its impressive clinical effect, DRZ is indicated only in patients with metastatic (in the EU also with advanced) breast cancer who have already received 300&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> doxorubicin (in the EU also epirubicin, 540&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Anecdotal evidence indicates a limited off-label use of DRZ in cancer patients with cardiac co-morbidities. DRZ is currently not approved for use in children and adolescents. Besides complex patent ownership and marketing history, the limited indication and use of DRZ reflect the persisting concerns of interference with antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], of induction of secondary malignancies, and of myelodysplastic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although recent meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] do not support these concerns. One study even reported prolonged, almost doubled, survival of doxorubicin (DOX) responders co-treated with DRZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The clinical acceptance of DRZ has also suffered from the incomplete understanding of its pharmacology. The cardioprotective effect of DRZ is usually attributed to iron chelating by ADR-925, an EDTA-like product of the enzymatic DRZ hydrolysis. This is consistent with the hypothesis of heart failure arising from iron-dependent oxidative stress triggered by &#x0201c;redox cycling&#x0201d; of anthracyclines. However, ADR-925 applied directly does not protect cardiomyocytes against anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Conversely, the inhibition of the enzymatic DRZ conversion to ADR-925 does not abolish the cardioprotective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, cardioprotective activities of DRZ analogues are unrelated to the rates of formation of their iron-chelating (i.e. ADR-925-like) metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally, the oxidative stress theory of anthracycline cardiotoxicity has been questioned, since oxidative stress is detectable in the heart following supra-clinical, but not clinically-relevant anthracycline doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, neither antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] nor iron chelators other than DRZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] prevent anthracycline-induced HF in cancer patients.</p><p>On the other hand, several investigators have observed depletion of the anthracycline target topoisomerase II&#x003b2; (TOP2B) in cells treated with DRZ or its analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Lyu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that DRZ-induced Top2b depletion prevented anthracycline-induced DNA damage in cardiomyocyte-derived H9C2 cells. Based on these observations, Lyu et al. proposed that DRZ prevents anthracycline-induced cardiomyocyte damage via TOP2B depletion. Importantly, this model also implicates that the anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is primarily driven by TOP2B-mediated DNA damage. In support of these findings, a recent study in cardiomyocyte-specific knockouts suggested the involvement of Top2b in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Importantly, Top2b deletion prevented DOX-driven mitochondrial damage, implicating this enzyme as a common denominator of the mitochondrial and DNA damage-based models of anthracycline cardiotoxicity.</p><p>The TOP2B-centered model of anthracycline-induced heart failure and its prevention by DRZ clearly needs further verification when weighed against the body of literature supporting the original oxidative stress hypothesis. Furthermore, this model is incompatible with some other findings. Thus, it is inexplicable why DRZ fully abolished DOX-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) from cultured cardiomyocytes, as DRZ left unchanged the expression level of the sister isoform Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (TOP2A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], an established DOX target. The TOP2A expression itself raises concerns regarding the validity of the cells used as a cardiomyocyte model, as it is usually expressed in proliferating and not post-mitotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, DRZ has been recently reported to deplete TOP2A from tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This depletion was proteasome-independent but it was associated with a strong reduction of TOP2A mRNA, whereas TOP2B mRNA remained unchanged. These results suggested that DRZ may deplete both TOP2B and TOP2A via different, transcriptional and proteolytic mechanisms, respectively. The verification of this possibility is important not only in organ protection but also for tumor treatments. Indeed, tumor TOP2A expression is a strong predictor of the therapeutic response to anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and its reduction by DRZ could be deleterious. Therefore, we set out to characterize the response of TOP2 isozymes to DRZ in cardiac and tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Drugs and antibodies</title><p>DRZ was purchased from Chiron (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), DOX was from Pfizer (Karlsruhe, Germany).

Wild-type residues of all five Top2A variants i.e. T49I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Y50F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], R162Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Y165S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and L169F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], are conserved between human TOP2A and TOP2B. The corresponding residues of TOP2B were individually mutated (T65I, Y66F, R178Q, Y181S, and L185F) by site-directed mutagenesis in a vector expressing wild-type human TOP2B with YFP fused at the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Plasmids encoding WT or mutated TOP2B were then transiently transfected into human fibrosarcoma-derived HTETOP cells. We employed for this experiment HTETOP cells, as they are easier to transfect and offer the possibility of tetracycline (TET)-mediated depletion of TOP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. With the exception of R178Q, all mutants were resistant to DRZ-induced depletion when compared to WT TOP2B in Western blot using anti-YFP antibody (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, upper panel). This was confirmed by an anti-TOP2B antibody, which also showed the expected depletion of the endogenous WT TOP2B following DRZ exposure (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, lower panel).</p><p>We then investigated if the four TOP2B mutants resistant to DRZ-induced depletion still exhibit protection against DOX-induced DSB. To be able to distinguish between DSB mediated by the transfected TOP2B-YFP and those mediated by endogenous TOP2A or TOP2B, the endogenous TOP2A was removed by pre-treatment with TET and TOP2B was knocked down using siRNA oligos targeting the 3-UTR (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The protein level of TOP2B-YFP expressed from transfected plasmids remained unchanged upon siRNA transfection (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) as the 3-UTR of TOP2B is absent from these constructs. DOX-induced DSB formation was much higher in cells depleted of endogenous TOP2A and TOP2B and transfected with wild-type or mutated TOP2B-YFP than in mock-transfected cells. As expected, DRZ attenuated DOX-induced DSB formation in cell transfected with wild-type TOP2B. In contrast, this protection was abolished by mutant M181 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, upper panel) and weakened by mutants M185, M65, and M66 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, lower panel). The above results were consistent with prevention of DOX-induced DSB by DRZ being mediated by the bisdioxopiperazine binding site of TOP2B.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

This was accompanied by TOP2B depletion and it was consistent with the involvement of TOP2B in DOX-induced DNA damage.

Simultaneously, it suggests mechanistic explanation for the inconsistent and sometimes contradictory reports of DRZ impact on anthracycline anticancer therapies. In the light of our data, these effects may be mediated by DRZ-triggered depletion of TOP2B.</p><p>The long-held view that cardioprotection involves iron-chelation by the EDTA-like product of the enzymatic DRZ hydrolysis ADR-925 has been recently questioned. Indeed, ADR-925 does not protect cardiomyocytes against anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], while prevention of its generation from DRZ does not abolish the cardioprotective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These observations implicate DRZ itself as the cardioprotective compound. As several previous studies demonstrated TOP2B depletion by DRZ and its analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we first verified these observations and investigated the underlying mechanism in more detail. We found DRZ capable of TOP2B depletion in all cell lines tested, including differentiated cardiomyocytes. In agreement with cell line data, we detected transient depletion of Top2b by DRZ in the mouse heart tissue, which constitutes a first report of this phenomenon <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We provide several lines of complementary evidence for DRZ-mediated TOP2B depletion being protective against anthracycline-induced DNA damage. The reduction of DOX-induced DNA damage by DRZ was associated with TOP2B depletion and it was similar to that observed upon TOP2B removal by siRNA. That this reduction was indeed mediated by the TOP2B removal was evidenced first of all by the differential effect of DRZ analogues. Thus, the reduction of DOX-induced DNA damage was conferred by TOP2B-binding and -depleting (DRZ, ICRF-193), but not by the non-binding and non-depleting bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-161. In contrast to DRZ, ICRF-161 is not protective against DOX-induced heart damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Taken together with our experiments, a bisdioxopiperazine&#x02019;s cardioprotective effect seems therefore to be determined by its capability to deplete TOP2B rather than to chelate iron. Indirectly, these results support the emerging evidence that anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is driven by TOP2B-mediated DNA damage rather than by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>To verify these conclusions mechanistically for the clinically relevant bisdioxopiperazine DRZ, we took advantage of the existing TOP2 DRZ resistance mutants. Strikingly, although not surprisingly, these mutants localize to the bisdioxopiperazine binding site in the N-terminal domain of TOP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All but one mutant prevented the depletion of TOP2B. Simultaneously, these mutants reduced the protective effect of DRZ against DOX-induced DNA damage. This result constitutes currently the strongest evidence that DRZ prevents DNA damage by depleting TOP2B, which is mediated through the bisdioxopiperazine binding site.</p><p>Taken together with the protective effect of a genetic Top2b deletion against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], our results suggest the following model of DRZ-mediated cardioprotection. DRZ depletes cardiac TOP2B, thereby reducing the substrate for DOX poisoning. Subsequent administration of an anthracycline results in lower levels of DNA damage than without DRZ pretreatment, i.e. in the presence of normal TOP2B levels. The depletion of TOP2B is transient, which reduces the risk or at least the duration of any adverse effects of this enzyme&#x02019;s deficiency. Although we have failed to measure DSB in vivo, this model is fully consistent with the reducing effect of DRZ on Top2b levels and Top2b-mediated DSB in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. Moreover, it is consistent with the observation that DRZ is no longer cardioprotective when given after anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], i.e. when DNA damage has already occurred.</p><p>The depletion of TOP2B by DRZ characterized in this study may also help to resolve the persisting concern of this drug&#x02019;s interference with antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines. This concern has its seeds in a randomized, double-blind study of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with fluorouracil, DOX, and cyclophosphamide with or without DRZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although time to progression and survival were not significantly different, DRZ-treated patients showed a lower tumor response rate, in addition to the expected reduction of cardiotoxicity. The reduction of the response rate is no longer statistically significant in the latest update of the pertinent Cochrane meta-analysis, but a trend remains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Based on the growing evidence of TOP2B depletion by DRZ and its molecular characterization in the present study, we would like to argue that DRZ may lower the response rate by depleting TOP2B. Although the anti-tumor effects of TOP2 poisons are usually attributed to TOP2A rather than TOP2B, the application of TOP2A level as a therapeutic predictor has been unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Quite the contrary, breast cancer survival can be predicted by TOP2B rather than TOP2A expression level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This could be explained by the TOP2B expression in &#x0003e;90% of cells in breast tumors. In contrast, TOP2A expression is restricted to the much smaller subset of proliferating (i.e. Ki67-positive) cells of breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A predominance of TOP2B in the combined TOP2A/TOP2B activity has been also described in ovarian tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>As confirmed in the present study, both TOP2 isoforms mediate DOX-induced DNA damage in tumor cells. DRZ-driven depletion of TOP2B would be expected to reduce this damage and thereby the elimination of tumor cells. The DRZ-driven depletion of TOP2B is apparently transient, which would likely minimize any long-term effects deleterious to tumor cell survival. In consequence, DRZ would be expected to reduce tumor shrinkage, a key component of the tumor response. These considerations are in agreement with the reduction of therapy response by DRZ detected in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, the reduction of tumor response by DRZ has been observed when DRZ was applied beginning with the first therapy course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. When given to breast cancer patients first when they had reached a cumulative DOX dose of 300&#x000a0;mg/m2, DRZ almost doubled the survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This effect is more difficult to explain in mechanistic terms, but it is important to remember that DRZ has some weak antitumor effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These effects could become manifest only when a certain tumor shrinkage has been achieved. In other words, initially better tumor shrinkage in the absence of DRZ could sensitize the tumor to this drug&#x02019;s anti-tumor effect when included into later therapy courses. Incidentally, this situation corresponds to the currently approved application of DRZ in breast cancer patients.</p><p>Finally, we verify and expand the original observation that DRZ may deplete TOP2A in addition to TOP2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This effect may be mediated by a mechanism different from that of TOP2B depletion, as it is independent from the proteasome activity but accompanied by lower TOP2A mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The depletion of TOP2A is less ubiquitous in comparison to TOP2B, as it has been detected only in some cell lines. The discrepancy of DRZ effects on TOP2A in H9C2 cells in this and a previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] may have been caused by our longer incubation times and by utilization of differentiated cells which express lower TOP2A levels. It is tempting to speculate that TOP2A depletion could account for the only side-effects of DRZ detected in current meta-analyses, i.e. low white blood count at nadir and anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Indeed, TOP2A is expressed predominantly in proliferating compartments such as bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The effects of DRZ on the stability and expression of TOP2 isoforms in normal tissues deserve detailed investigations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>DRZ may prevent doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through depleting TOP2A and TOP2B.
