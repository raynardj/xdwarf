using a sliding rehabilitation machine (SRM) on the gait function of cerebral palsy
children. [Subjects and Methods] Thirteen children aged 6&#x02013;18 years participated in the SRM
training for 8 weeks (30&#x02005;min/day, 2 times/week). The SRM is designed for the performance
of a closed-kinetic chain exercise in which a tilt table is moved up and down using wheels
on the table. Participants began in a position of flexion of the 3 lower joints (hips,
knees, and ankles) on the SRM. In each exercise session, they extended and flexed the 3
joints. The level of exercise was set by changing the inclination of the tilt table.
Functional gait ability was measured with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), 10-m walk test
(10MWT), and timed up-and-go test (TUG) before and after the training. Muscle strength was
also measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. [Results] Nine of the thirteen children
completed the entire study. The peak torques of the knee extensor and flexor group muscles
significantly improved after training with the SRM. The total distance of the 6 MWT
significantly increased after training. The times of the 10 MWT and the TUG significantly
improved after training. The changes in muscle tone were also investigated using the MAS
(Modified Ashworth Scale) and Tardieu scale, but no significant changes were found in
muscle tone between the pre- and post-test measurements. [Conclusion] The findings
demonstrate the effect of the SRM intervention which resulted in improved muscle strength
and functional gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Sliding rehabilitation machine</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP), which is the most common physical developmental disability in
childhood, describes a group of disorders in the development of movement and posture that
cause activity limitations, and are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occur in
the developing brains of infants<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The impairment in cerebral palsy, including
secondary impairments such as spasticity, muscle contracture, bone deformity, muscle
weakness, and coordination disorders, is multifactorial and is characterized primarily in
the lower extremities, which account for most of the functional impairments seen in CP, such
as deficits in walking ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvement in gait function is a primary concern of
patients and their caregivers. Thus, it has naturally become the most important aim of
treatment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. To treat impaired gait,
strengthening exercises, such as sit-to-stand (STS) exercises have been attempted. In a
study using electromyographic analysis, Berger and Olney reported that muscle weakness is
the principal component of limited or decreased gait ability in children with cerebral
palsy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hua-Fung Liau et al. reported that loaded sit-to-stand exercises
improved basic motor abilities, functional muscle strength, and walking efficiency<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the application of STS exercises
is limited to patients who have sufficient power to maintain a standing position or who do
not have severe contractures of the plantar flexor. Therefore, in this study, a sliding
rehabilitation machine (SRM) was used because the SRM can provide partial body weight
support by adjusting the inclination of the supporting carriage. It is also possible to
allow the patients&#x02019; feet to make full contact with the plate by adjusting the inclination of
the footplate. Furthermore, the SRM can facilitate the performance of forced use exercise by
removing the footplate of the unaffected side, and it can also provide weight bearing
exercise by controlling center-of-gravity movement, with the trunk fixed on the
carriage<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, in SRM, the
angle of knee flexion can be better controlled than in the sit to stand exercise. Lee
reported that sit-to-stand performance at different angles of knee flexion by individuals
with hemiparesis changed the peak value of plantar pressure and the symmetry of the gait
pattern<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.Therefore, this study was
designed to determine the effect of strength exercises, using SRM, on the muscle power and
gait function of children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirteen children who visited an outpatient clinic for treatment were recruited for this

age from 6 to 18&#x02005;years old; and ability to follow verbal instructions. Children who were
not able to walk independently, or with an orthosis, or who had any disease that might
have had a negative effect on the results were excluded. Children who had undergone
surgery or who had received Botox treatment within the previous 6 months were also
excluded. All the subject&#x02019;s parents or guardians understood the purpose of this study and
gave their prior written consent to their children&#x02019;s participation, in accordance with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from our
local university and hospital research ethics boards.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The children and their parents were provided information about the purpose, method,
advantages or inconveniences, warnings, and the test schedule of this study. A SRM was
used in this study. It consists of a patient-supporting carriage, a footplate, and a
Velcro safety strap that is connected to the carriage. It also has a rail system, which is
designed to allow the patients to perform a closed-kinetic chain exercise by moving the
tilt table up and down using the wheels on the table. The wheels, which minimize
frictional force, make the exercise easier. In this exercise, participants began in a
position of flexion of the hips, knees, and ankles. In each exercise session, the patients
extended the hips, knees and ankles from the flexed posture and then returned them to
their original flexed posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>SRM training</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1667-g001"/></fig>). The level of exercise was set according to the level of weight supported by
changing the inclination of the tilt table for each patient. Adjusting the inclination of
the footplate to produce full contact between the soles and plates made the exercise
possible for those patients who had difficulty performing plantar flexion due to severe
contracture. During the exercise, Velcro straps were fixed to the patient&#x02019;s trunks and
ankles for their safety. All of the children who participated in this study trained with
the sliding rehabilitation machine for 30 minutes per day, twice a week for 8 weeks, with
concurrent conventional Bobath therapy. The intensity of the exercise was controlled by
increasing the inclination of the carriage and by adjusting the number of trials per
session. Break times were also provided when the children requested rest, but they were
minimized as the training progressed. Every training session was conducted under the
supervision of an experienced physical therapist. To confirm the effects of the training
with the SRM, functional gait ability was measured with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT),
10-m walk test (10MWT), and timed up-and-go test (TUG). Muscle strength was measured using
an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex International, Inc., USA). The peak torque was measured
during flexion and extension exercises of the knee joint before and after the training.
Furthermore, tests for possible adverse effects, such as changes in muscle tone, were
performed the pre and post-test. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 18.0 for
Windows. Non-parametric tests were used as not all data were normally distributed. To
identify the changes in each parameter between before and after the training with the SRM,
Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank test was used. Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05 in
the statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Nine of the thirteen children completed the entire study, and 4 children withdrew before
the completion of this study because the children or their parents did not want to continue
due to academic problems or conflicts in scheduling. Subject 4 started the SRM training
during his school vacation. As a new semester started, however, he could not continue the
SRM training because of regular school classes and additional private lessons. Subjects 1
and 3 were excluded from the analysis because their attendance rates were low during the
2-month training period. Subject 2 was transferred to another hospital because her parents
wanted whole-day treatment, so she also could not continue the SRM training. The remaining
children completed the entire training and all of the tests.</p><p>The peak torque of the knee extensor muscles had significantly improved after the training
with the SRM (p&#x0003c;0.05); the mean value increased from 31.11&#x000b1;7.42 to 40.55&#x000b1;10.37 Nm. The
peak torque of the knee flexor also significantly improved after the training (p&#x0003c;0.05);
the mean value increased from 20.22&#x000b1;16.2 to 26.33&#x000b1;19.11 Nm. The total distance of the 6MWT
significantly increased after the training (p&#x0003c;0.05); the mean value increased from
227.14&#x000b1;42.93 to 260.951&#x000b1;48.71 meters. The times taken for the 10MWT and the TUG had
significantly decreased after the training, compared with before training (p&#x0003c;0.05). The
mean values of these tests decreased from 16.42&#x000b1;3.71 to 14.14&#x000b1;3.52 sec and from 25.17&#x000b1;7.53
to 21.79&#x000b1;6.43 sec, respectively. No adverse effects, such as seizures or pain, occurred
during the intervention. In addition, the changes in muscle tone were also investigated
using the MAS and Tardieu scale, but no significant changes were found in muscle tone
between the pre- and post-test measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The findings of this study indicate that SRM might provide a useful therapeutic
intervention for the improvement of the muscle strength and walking ability of children with
cerebral palsy. Several studies have reported that when hemiplegic patients with stroke
performed strengthening exercises using a sliding rehabilitation machine, their muscle
strength and walking ability significantly improved after the training. In the current
study, muscle strength was significantly improved by training with the SRM. This finding is
in agreement with those previous studies which reported that the strength of the quadriceps
femoris muscle of children with cerebral palsy improved as a result of resistance
exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study subjects showed
improvements in walking ability after training using the SRM. We believe that this finding
is explained by an increase in muscle strength sufficient to improve functioning. For
children with diplegia, weight could be distributed on both the soles by adjusting the
inclination of the footplate, and strengthening could be focused on the qaudriceps muscle,
by fixing the trunk on the carriage. Consequently, the muscle strength of the quadriceps
significantly improved. Furthermore, for the hemiplegic children, it was possible to conduct
forced use exercise through concentrating the weight only on the paretic limb by removing
the footplate from the opposite, nonparetic side<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, increased muscular strength of the quadriceps femoris
would make it possible to counteract the hamstring muscle and increase the stride length by
decreasing the cadence which results from overcompensatory action<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We thought that strengthening of the ankle plantarflexor was improved by enabling full
contact of the feet with the plate by adjusting the inclination of the footplate. Ankle
plantarflexor strengthening may lead to improvements in the gait function of children with
cerebral palsy<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it is
believed that improved strength can facilitate faster and more stable walking by increasing
the angular velocity during extension and by improving the stability of the joints<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the number of patients who participated in this
study was somewhat small. Second, the simple design did not include a control group. Third,
follow-up testing of the sustainability of the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness was not
performed. However, despite these limitations, this study is meaningful because the
effectiveness of the SRM for children with cerebral palsy was objectively confirmed and has
been presented for the first time. Additional studies will be needed which address these
limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Daegu University Research Grant, 2011.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Himmelmann</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagberg</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Beckung</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The changing panorama of cerebral palsy in Sweden.
