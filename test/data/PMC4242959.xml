postural control in stroke patients during standing as compared with age-matched healthy
subjects. [Subjects and Methods] In total, 46 stroke patients and 37 age-matched healthy
subjects were recruited for the study. A stabilometer was used to assess postural
stability in participants during standing, with or without active head rotation, and with
their eyes open or closed. Subjects were asked to stand on a force plate while rotating
their head in the yaw plane at a frequency of 1.0&#x02005;Hz. A metronome was used to maintain the
head rotation frequency, and the head rotation range was maintained at a total of 70&#x000b0;
during the postural stability examinations. [Results] The control of postural stability
during standing with active head rotation was significantly decreased in the stroke group
as compared with the healthy group with both the eyes open and closed. No significant
differences in relation to standing without head motion were observed between groups.
[Conclusion] The findings suggest that postural instability is increased in stroke
patients during active head rotation, and therefore, vestibular function in relation to
head rotation might be reduced in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke patients</kwd><kwd>Postural stability</kwd><kwd>Vestibular function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As components of the sensory system of the body, the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory
senses play an important role in postural stability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proper coordination of these
senses in relation to changes in the immediate environment helps prevent falls, and the
impairment of this coordination can adversely affect the control of posture, thus increasing
the risk of falls. In particular, studies on neurological diseases have indicated that
strokes increase the risk of falls because of various impairments in the motor and high
cerebral functions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a potential
compensatory mechanism for these impairments, stroke patients tend to rely more on visual
sensory information than vestibular or somatosensory information in the sensory system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, paradoxically, the acquisition of
important visual information can increase the occurrence of falls, because rapid head
movement can cause retinal slip and degrade visual acuity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study, even healthy subjects were shown to lose
postural stability during active head movements<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this postural perturbation due to head movements is
further increased in stroke patients. Therefore, stroke patients may not adequately
coordinate their postural control with head movement, which might result in a high risk of
falling as compared with healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
effect of active head rotation on postural control in stroke patients while they stood as
compared with age-matched healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by a local ethics committee, and subjects provided written informed
consent. Stroke patients were enrolled in the study if they (1) had experienced their first
hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke within the past 6 months (from stroke onset) and (2) had the
ability to stand barefoot in an upright position with both feet together on a platform
without support and with eyes closed for more than 60 seconds. Based on these inclusion
criteria, a total of 46 stroke patients were enrolled in this study. Lesions encompassed the
following cerebral areas of the stroke patients: brain stem (19.6%), putamen (15.2%),
thalamus (13.0%), frontal lobe (10.9%), parietal lobe (8.7%), temporal lobe (8.7%),
cerebellum (8.7%), occipital lobe (6.5%), corona radiata (6.5%), and basal ganglia (2.2%).
The control group consisted of 37 age-matched healthy subjects.</p><p>Postural stability was examined using a stabilometer (G-620; Anima Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
Each subject was asked to stand barefoot in an upright position with both feet together on a
platform and with both the eyes open or closed for 60 seconds. In the eye-open condition,
the subjects&#x02019; eyes were fixated on a target (1.0&#x02005;cm in diameter), which was positioned at
the same height as the subjects&#x02019; eyes. In the eye-open and eye-closed conditions, postural
control was measured in the participants while they stood without head motion (static
standing) or with active head rotation. Postural control during static standing was measured
with subjects standing quietly on a force plate. Moreover, postural control during active
head rotation was measured with subjects standing on the force plate while rotating their
head in the yaw plane at a frequency of 1.0&#x02005;Hz. A metronome was used to maintain the head
rotation frequency, and the head rotation range was maintained at a total of 70&#x000b0; during the
postural stability examinations. During the examination, subjects were requested not to
compensate for their movement with trunk movement. The measurements were repeated if trunk
movement occurred. The locus length (LNG) was used for evaluating the stroke and control
groups and was calculated as the total movement distance from the center of pressure.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), and
the level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed the
data were not normally distributed; therefore, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare
the values of the stroke patients with those of the healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences in postural control during static standing were observed between
the study groups. However, the control of postural stability during standing with active
head rotation was significantly decreased in the stroke group as compared with the healthy

during standing with active head rotation as compared with age-matched healthy subjects in
both the eye-open and eye-closed conditions. Previous research has suggested that the
sensory system for postural control stabilizes the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory
information to achieve consistency<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
those with sensory deficits, rapid head movements may cause retinal slip and degradation of
visual acuity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. During these movements,
the sensory strategy allows for compensation of visual function via vestibular and
somatosensory information. In particular, the vestibular sensory regions experience
increased activation due to head motion<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>,
which contributes to postural stability. A previous study has shown that vestibular function
is involved in maintaining postural stability during head rotation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the methods of the present study could have activated
vestibular sensory function. However, many patients with hemiplegia cannot adequately reduce
their weight to utilize vestibular information and rely on visual input. Thus, the
vestibular senses of stroke patients are decreased as compared with those of healthy
subjects, which can affect their postural stability during standing with head motion in both
the eye-open and eye-closed conditions. Stroke damages a part of the neural network of the
affected hemisphere and consequently can impact not only motor function but also the
vestibular and somatosensory senses. Extensive anatomical connections are present between
the cerebral cortex and the vestibular system. Of interest, in a functional magnetic
resonance imaging study of the multisensory cortical signal changes occurring during
vestibular galvanic stimulation, the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, putamen, and
parieto-insular vestibular cortex were found to be active<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, many stroke patients showed impairment of
these cerebral regions, which might have been related to the reduced ability for postural
control.</p><p>This study had several limitations. It was difficult to conclude whether the area of the
injured brain affected the postural stability of the patients. Furthermore, in the
evaluation of postural control, visual acuity was not evaluated. In future studies, the
cerebral activation during head rotation should be considered, and the effect of visual
acuity should be assessed using a dynamic visual acuity test.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Shumway-Cook</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Woollacott</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group>: Motor Control: translating research into clinical practice, 4th ed.
