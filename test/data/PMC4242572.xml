In Cambridgeshire, U.K., a long-term initiative to convert drained, intensively farmed arable land to a wetland habitat mosaic is driven by a desire both to prevent biodiversity loss from the nationally important Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve (Wicken Fen NNR) and to increase the provision of ecosystem services. We evaluated the changes in ecosystem service delivery resulting from this land conversion, using a new Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) to estimate biophysical and monetary values of ecosystem services provided by the restored wetland mosaic compared with the former arable land. Overall results suggest that restoration is associated with a net gain to society as a whole of $199 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, for a one-off investment in restoration of $2320 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Restoration has led to an estimated loss of arable production of $2040 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but estimated gains of $671 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in nature-based recreation, $120 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> from grazing, $48 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> from flood protection, and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worth an estimated $72 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Management costs have also declined by an estimated $1325 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Despite uncertainties associated with all measured values and the conservative assumptions used, we conclude that there was a substantial gain to society as a whole from this land-use conversion. The beneficiaries also changed from local arable farmers under arable production to graziers, countryside users from towns and villages, and the global community, under restoration. We emphasize that the values reported here are not necessarily transferable to other sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arable production</kwd><kwd>biodiversity conservation</kwd><kwd>ecosystem services</kwd><kwd>flood protection</kwd><kwd>global climate change mitigation</kwd><kwd>nature-based recreation</kwd><kwd>wetland restoration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Restoration and safeguarding of ecosystems that provide essential ecosystem services (including degraded land) have been recognized by the international community as important means to enhance and maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services, as articulated in Aichi Targets 14 and 15 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011&#x02013;2020 agreed by parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October 2010 (CBD <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As investments in implementing the Strategic Plan accelerate, governments need information on the relative costs and benefits of particular actions, including ecological restoration, needed to achieve these targets (CBD <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In this paper, we assume that for the purposes of valuing ecosystem services, ecosystems can be defined spatially and temporally and use the term ecosystem services to mean the benefits that people receive from ecosystems.</p><p>Ecological restoration is usually carried out to benefit biodiversity. There is increasing interest in its effects on ecosystem services, although both may be lower in restoration sites than in the natural habitats that previously existed there (Palmer and Filoso <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Rey Benayas et al. <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A meta-analysis of 621 restored wetlands shows poor recovery of both biological structures (e.g., plant assemblages) and functioning (e.g., carbon storage), which remain 26% and 23% lower, respectively, than in reference sites (Moreno-Mateos et al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Irreversible damage to previous ecosystems can explain this discrepancy, although trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services may change through time after restoration starts (Bullock et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Where restoration projects emphasize the establishment of ecosystem processes, biodiversity outcomes are less predictable in space and through time (Hughes et al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), but may also more easily achieve ecosystem service gains than projects that are more prescriptive in their spatial planning of habitats and related species targets (Fisher et al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Perring et al. <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>At the Wicken Fen Vision project in Cambridgeshire, U.K., conversion of drained arable land to restored wetland is being carried out by the National Trust, a nongovernmental organization that owns the site (National Trust <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Some local councilors and farmers have argued that loss of food production is not in the national or local interest (East Cambridgeshire District Council <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In order to elucidate the trade-offs at the center of this debate, we carried out a comparative assessment of the ecosystem services at both the wetland restoration site and on adjacent arable land. To achieve this, we used the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-Scale Assessment (TESSA), a framework for rapid assessment of ecosystem service provision by a site of interest in its current state and in its most likely alternative state (Peh et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study area</title><p>The fenland basin of East Anglia in the UK is used for intensive arable agriculture on remnant peat soils of what was once a vast floodplain wetland of about 3850 km<sup>2</sup> (Moore <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Major drainage during the 17th and 19th centuries left only four areas of the original undrained fen wetland, covering just 7.13 km<sup>2</sup> (0.18%) between them (Rowell, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). One of these, Wicken Fen NNR (52&#x000b0;18&#x02032;24N, 0&#x000b0;16&#x02032;51E), includes undrained alkaline peats up to four meters in depth and supports seminatural, biodiverse, alkaline fen habitats (Mountford et al. <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Despite its small size (170 ha), it has over 8000 species, many of them rare fen specialist invertebrates. Extinction of some of these rare species is thought to be related to Wicken Fen NNR's small size and inadequate inputs of base-rich groundwater (Colston and Friday <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Therefore, some of the adjacent farmland was purchased in 1993 by the National Trust (at market prices) and subsequently converted to a mosaic of wetland and terrestrial habitats.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location of Wicken Fen NNR and the Wicken Fen Vision project land used in this study.

The project was explicitly intended to increase ecosystem service provision as well as to provide new habitats for wildlife, through increased recreation opportunities and reduced rates of soil organic carbon loss (Colston <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The project currently covers 770 ha, including Wicken Fen NNR.</p><p>The restored land has structurally damaged peat soils of 20- to 80- cm depth (Stroh et al. <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Most of the restored area is partially flooded in winter and is managed year-round with low-density semi-feral grazing animals. In addition, some areas in the first few years of restoration are seasonally grazed by domestic livestock belonging to local farmers. The adjacent land is almost all under intensive arable agriculture, as was the wetland site before restoration, growing various annual crops (Cook <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The area is hydrologically complex with canalized rivers elevated c. 3 m above the land level because the drained peats have oxidized and shrunk. The ditch system that drains the farmland is c. 3 m below land level, and its water is lifted into the rivers at a pumping station.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of ecosystem services</title><p>In this study, we used methods from the TESSA toolkit to compare ecosystem service values of the restored wetland with those of the adjacent arable land. We chose this toolkit because it enables the collection of high resolution, site-scale data, relevant to decisions being made at the Wicken Fen Vision, without the need for specialist technical knowledge of the modeling approaches or GIS software typical of most currently available tools such as INVEST (Tallis et al. <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) or ARIES (Bagstad et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The TESSA toolkit also allowed the ecosystem services assessment to be made rapidly with little field work or substantial investment of staff time. This is in part because the toolkit currently provides valuation approaches for only five ecosystem service areas (Global climate regulation, water-related services, harvested wild goods, cultivated goods, and nature-based recreation) and in part because some forms of economic valuation within the toolkit are simplified versions of more complex and difficult valuation techniques. For example, simple measurements of expenditure on travel to a nature reserve and tourism spend at the nature reserve are used instead of more sophisticated revealed preference methods (Bateman et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) such as the travel cost method (Bockstael and McConnell <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Samos Juarez and Bernabeu Canete <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), resulting in more conservative valuations.</p><p>We first assessed the ecosystem service values of a contiguous block of 479 ha of restored wetland. We then used data from immediately adjacent arable land to estimate what the ecosystem service value of this 479 ha block of land would be if it was still under arable cultivation (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). We convened a meeting of key stakeholders involved at the wetland restoration site including staff from the National Trust, representatives of the U.K. Environment Agency and Natural England who have oversight on flooding, water abstraction, and biodiversity, respectively, university researchers and local volunteers working at the site. This consultation identified the main, readily measured ecosystem services provided by the restored wetland as (1) global climate change mitigation, (2) nature-based recreation, (3) flood protection, and (4) the provision of grazing. Arable production (5) was identified as the key ecosystem service of the arable land, but local stakeholders (residents who use the area recreationally or are local parish councilors or landowners) identified recreational services as important on arable land as well as on the restored wetland. Non-use values such as existence and bequest value were also identified as important but are far less amenable to quantification and so were not assessed here. As data collection was carried out in 2011, all values were estimated in British pounds and converted to US dollars using a yearly average exchange rate for 2011 of 1 GBP = 1.541 USD.</p><sec><title>Global climate change mitigation</title><p>We assessed fluxes of greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4,</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) for the site under the current and alternative land uses, based on appropriate, published, peer-reviewed values and including emissions from soil, plant, and animal sources (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). We converted net flux of each gas (in tonnes ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) into tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents (CO<sub>2eq</sub>) ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and summed these to give a net global warming potential (over 100 years &#x02013; GWP<sub>100</sub>) ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> under each land use (Forster et al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). These values are also expressed as a total value of tonnes CO<sub>2eq</sub> y<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>1</sup> for the whole site. We used the standard convention of positive values indicating net atmospheric warming. Ranges for all values were calculated using the published uncertainties for each flux additively.

Most studies assess just one. Given the rapid nature of our assessment, we focused on the more tractable elements of the first type of measure &#x02013; direct expenditure &#x02013; and specifically visitor spend at the site itself and in traveling to get there. The amount spent on travel reflects the minimum value a visitor places on a site for recreation, that is, the cost of getting there, and therefore tends to be a conservative value of nature-based recreation (Farber et al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The amount spent by tourists on, for example, food and accommodation, are also important aspects of their total spend on their recreational experience because they are monetary transactions related to tourism. By adding them to the amount spent on travel, the total measured recreational value becomes less conservative but it remains an incomplete analysis of the recreational value of the site because non-market components have not been included (Wells <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).</p><p>We estimated the value of nature-based recreation from the direct expenditure by visitors to the site including local tourists (&#x0201c;day-trippers&#x0201d;), national, and international tourists. We estimated the annual number of person-visits to the restored wetland from gate entry data combined with a field survey carried out at the two main access points to the study area on 7 days in late summer (August, September, and October), 2011. These 7 days were chosen to represent the different types of &#x0201c;visitor-days&#x0201d; as identified and classified by the National Trust (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S2</xref>). We used a questionnaire survey to obtain information on distance travelled, mode of transport, places visited, expenditure in the shop and caf&#x000e9;, and likelihood of visiting restored wetland and arable farmland (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Grazing</title><p>Grazing is carried out on some of the most recently acquired restoration wetland through commercially priced agreements with local farmers.

Neither the arable farmland nor Wicken NNR have flood storage capacity, but part of the restored wetland at Wicken has been configured to act as a flood storage area for a 1-in-20-year flood event (Convine and Starling <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). We estimated the total benefit of this as the value of the avoided damage to crops and property (as calculated by Convine and Starling (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), updated with current information on the value of crops and property) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Arable production</title><p>We estimated the value of arable production from published economic data on farming in the surrounding region. Crop selection was established based on a land-use survey of the surrounding regions in 2008 (Cook <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The mean per hectare output and costs of farming in the region were obtained from summaries of standard farm accounts reported in the annual Farm Business Survey for 2010&#x02013;2011 (Lang <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and were adjusted to exclude items of income and expenditure not directly related to arable production (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). In particular, we excluded agricultural subsidies received by farmers (and by the National Trust for its restored land) under the European Union Common Agricultural Policy, as these do not represent a net benefit to society but rather an internal transfer of value from one part of society to another (Bateman et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We also excluded miscellaneous farm activities unrelated to the production of crops, and we excluded interest and rental costs relating to the farmland itself (to be consistent with the analysis of the restored wetland; see below). Finally, we included a value for unpaid manual labor (predominantly that of the farmer and spouse) &#x02013; this is generally omitted from reported costs, but represents a real cost to the production of cultivated goods.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Calculation of the output and costs attributable to arable production based on financial data presented in Lang (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) for cereal farms (growing mainly wheat, barley, and oats) in The Fens (the region in which the Wicken Fen Vision land is located) and for general cropping farms (growing mainly onion, oilseed rape, and root crops) in Cambridgeshire.

(The given range is the minimum and maximum likely emissions value based on the range of emissions factors used in the literature and their published uncertainties and using the highest and lowest reported emissions factors (and associated errors) for each GHG). The majority of this value derives from emissions from the soil and vegetation (either soil carbon oxidation or CH<sub>4</sub> production, depending on water table) with only a small amount (approximately 255 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) deriving from grazing animals.

Most visitors (93%) were day-trippers from within the region. Domestic and international tourists represented 6% and 1% of the total visitors, respectively. Based on National Trust data, 44,813 people visited the NNR in 2010. Hence, based on the proportions above (collected in 2011), we estimated that in 2010, a total of 32,451 people visited the restored wetland only, of which 30,283 were day-trippers (24,977 adult day-trippers, 5306 children).</p><p>From the total reported expenditure of our respondents on travel and in the gift shop and cafe, we estimated the total annual recreational revenue from the people who visited only the restored wetland to be $387,920 ($810 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; day-trippers contributed $286,666, national tourists $90,107, and international tourists $11,148) (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>; Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>).

Of this, 50 ha would be flooded during a 1-in-20-year flood event and would probably reduce in value for grazing, while the remaining 1950 ha would have a high water table that would only allow cereal crops rather than higher value root crops to be grown (Graves and Morris <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition, 10 houses would be directly affected by flood damage (Convine and Starling <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). The total flood cost was estimated at $461,505, comprised of $245,264 due to crop loss or land-use change and $216,241 of damage to homes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S3</xref>).

This estimate is based on the US Government price for carbon and increases substantially to around $193,000 y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ($403 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) when UK Government carbon prices are used (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>). This estimate is based on the prices for 2011 and will necessarily fluctuate between years because of changing market prices for carbon and for services such as arable production. This might lead to smaller differences in value between the two land uses in some years. The main ecosystem services that have been gained at Wicken Fen as a result of restoration are enhanced nature-based recreation, reduced GHG emissions, increased flood protection and increased grazing by domestic stock (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). The main service lost after restoration is arable production. These results, however, have varying levels of confidence related to the accuracy and precision of the data (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref>), because some of the rapid techniques we used are simplified versions of well-established methods.</p><p>We omitted several services that are likely to be provided by restored wetland because we could not measure them. Perhaps most importantly and related to the original aims of the Wicken Fen Vision, we did not measure the enhancement of the wildlife value of the restoration land and its potential to buffer and make more viable the populations of rare species that occupy Wicken Fen NNR. New wetlands can reduce phosphorus and nitrogen loadings downstream through storage and recycling of nutrients (H&#x000e5;kanson and Bryhn <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Additionally, when arable land is converted to wetland, inputs of agrochemicals into surface waters and ground water (as well as GHG emissions from applying them) are reduced. Changes to water quality were not measured because no suitable inflow or outflow sites were present at which comparative measurements could be made. Ecological restoration can also lead to soil quality improvements, but we were unable to evaluate these. Likewise, we did not measure methane emissions from ditches on arable land or services such as spiritual enrichment or educational value of the restored wetland. Our overall valuation of the ecosystem services of the restoration site relative to the arable land is likely to be conservative because of these omissions.</p><p>It is also important to note that the value of nature-based recreation is unlikely to rise linearly in proportion to the area of land restored because its marginal benefit is likely to fall (Brander et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Bateman et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Nature-based recreation accounts for a large part of the value of the restored wetland, and thus, it is important to monitor its value over time to understand both changes in marginal benefit and the sensitivity of the overall valuation of services to this component. Results for all measured ecosystem services in this study are not necessarily applicable to other wetland restoration sites as many measurements were highly site specific (e.g., flood protection).</p><p>In a study of the value of ecological restoration on peat soils that are currently farmed in England, it is estimated that restoring existing arable land in The Fens to high, peat-forming water table conditions which exclude agriculture would provide a net value of around $2390 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (&#x000a3;1549 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) &#x000b1; 50&#x02013;75% (Morris et al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This value is based on changes in carbon losses, GHG emissions, acidification effects of ammonia and sulfur, and in cultural services and is considerably higher than the conservative $199 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> reported in our study which includes a different range of ecosystem services.</p><p>A significant reason for this difference is that Morris et al. (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) use a value of 4.20 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> GHG emissions for restored land and 26.17 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for cultivated land (both on deep fenland peats) taken from Natural England (<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), compared with mid-range values of 1.69 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 4.85 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, for these two land-use types used in our study. We chose a conservative value for the land under restoration at Wicken Fen Vision because this has a very degraded peat profile, consisting of only a thin remnant, wasted peat soil over clay subsoil (Stroh et al. <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>),and we used emission factors appropriate for such soils from Bradley (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref> &#x02013; cited in Natural England <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Morrison et al. (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The estimates by Morris et al. (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and ours may reflect the upper and lower GWP<sub>100</sub> of fenland peat under arable cultivation. It is likely that there are greater savings of emissions, particularly avoided losses of CO<sub>2</sub>, to be made if deeper peat residues are restored to more extensive use, than those actually restored at Wicken Fen. In a later study, Graves and Morris (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) estimate peatland restoration to have a net value in 2012 of around &#x000a3;150 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> rising to between &#x000a3;300 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and over &#x000a3;1000 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2080 depending on the climate change scenario measured in terms of agricultural production and carbon emissions only.</p><p>This raises the issue of the sustainability of the continuing arable use of land compared with restored wetland, which is not addressed by the data in our study. The study by Morris et al. (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) calculates that where peat soils have wasted away, the value of land in agricultural use in the Fens drops to around US$46 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Fenland peat is estimated to waste at an annual rate of 7&#x02013;21 mm (Holman <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), so that soils in the Wicken area that are often as little as 30 cm in depth will only last for 30 more years (a conservative estimate as these rates may rise with temperature increases (Davidson &#x00026; Janssens <xref rid="b500" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>)). Across the fenland basin, Graves and Morris (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) estimate that soils will last a further 30&#x02013;100 years, depending on their current depth and use. On the other hand, especially where water tables can be maintained near the soil surface, restored wetlands will maintain and possibly accumulate peat (Kivim&#x000e4;ki et al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Neither our study nor Morris et al. (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) include all the costs associated with drainage and pumping of water into rivers. These include the funding to drainage commissioners from central government via district authorities who levy charges on all nonagricultural properties covered by their area, and funding from the Environment Agency for water that the commissioners manage and that comes from outside their area (Middle Level Commissioners, personal communication, 12th November 2012). If these omitted costs of drainage were included, our estimates of the restoration benefits would increase.</p><p>A change in land use from arable to a restored wetland mosaic alters not only the type and value of ecosystem services generated but also the distribution of benefits (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>). Under arable production, a small number of landowners and their employees gain the majority of the ecosystem service benefits provided by the site &#x02013; as well as a sizeable direct subsidy from the taxpayer (not counted here, but worth, based on the Farm Business Survey, an estimated $177,000 y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ($370 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (Rural Business Research (RBR) Farm Business Survey database <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)). Consumers of the food produced are also beneficiaries, but restoration has only a marginal impact on this group compared with the impact on farmers for whom the arable land provides the main income. Under restoration, there is greater societal benefit to a much broader range of stakeholders, including many more local (and some long-distance) visitors, as well as the global community (through reduced greenhouse gas emissions). Yet most of these benefits do not accrue to the landowner, who (in the absence of related incentives such as carbon payments) is therefore encouraged to continue arable production rather than undertake restoration (Firbank et al. <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>This mismatch between private and public benefits can be reflected in political ambivalence about restoration, which may be improved by better engagement with landowners over the costs and benefits of restoration (Moss <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In the case of the Wicken Vision project, East Cambridgeshire District Council voted to support it in 2006, but (encouraged by a small number of local people, including some farmers) withdrew that support in 2008, before reinstating it in 2011 (East Cambridgeshire District Council <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We suggest that the data reported here could be used to inform this kind of debate. More generally, we hope that our approach for rapidly evaluating a broad range of services under contrasting land uses can be used to identify those of greatest benefit to society as a whole, and hence to inform a wider debate about the purpose and scope of publicly funded incentives to landowners. However, a close inspection of the transferability of values between sites is crucial so that inappropriate results are not used in these debates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by the Cambridge Conservation Initiative Collaborative Fund and Arcadia (Research grant no.
