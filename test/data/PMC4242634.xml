In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) arise from a pool of primordial germ cells (PGCs) that remain undifferentiated even after gametogenesis has initiated. The decision of PGCs to differentiate or remain undifferentiated is regulated by somatic stromal cells: specifically, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling activated in the stromal cells determines the fraction of germ cells that remain undifferentiated by shaping a Decapentaplegic (Dpp) gradient that represses PGC differentiation. However, little is known about the contribution of germ cells to this process. Here we show that a novel germline factor, Gone early (Goe), limits the fraction of PGCs that initiate gametogenesis. <italic>goe</italic> encodes a non-peptidase homologue of the Neprilysin family metalloendopeptidases. At the onset of gametogenesis, Goe was localized on the germ cell membrane in the ovary, suggesting that it functions in a peptidase-independent manner in cell&#x02013;cell communication at the cell surface. Overexpression of Goe in the germline decreased the number of PGCs that enter the gametogenic pathway, thereby increasing the proportion of undifferentiated PGCs. Inversely, depletion of Goe increased the number of PGCs initiating differentiation. Excess PGC differentiation in the <italic>goe</italic> mutant was augmented by halving the dose of <italic>argos</italic>, a somatically expressed inhibitor of EGFR signaling. This increase in PGC differentiation resulted in a massive decrease in the number of undifferentiated PGCs, and ultimately led to insufficient formation of GSCs. Thus, acting cooperatively with a somatic regulator of EGFR signaling, the germline factor <italic>goe</italic> plays a critical role in securing the proper size of the GSC precursor pool. Because <italic>goe</italic> can suppress EGFR signaling activity and is expressed in EGF-producing cells in various tissues, <italic>goe</italic> may function by attenuating EGFR signaling, and thereby affecting the stromal environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (grant # 14436948) to M.A. from MEXT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html">http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html</ext-link>), a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (grant # 13350457) to M.A. from MEXT, and a Research Fellowship for Young Scientists to S.M.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse, this is achieved by implementing two developmental pathways: direct gamete production from undifferentiated primordial germ cells (PGCs), and lifelong production of gametes from germline stem cells (GSCs) <xref rid="pone.0113423-Asaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. GSCs arise from a subset of PGCs; allocation of some PGCs to a special microenvironment, called the niche, establishes their identity as GSCs <xref rid="pone.0113423-Spradling1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, the direct gametogenesis pathway is triggered before GSC establishment <xref rid="pone.0113423-Asaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113423-King1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; therefore, a subset of PGCs must somehow resist the overtly differentiating environment and remain in an undifferentiated state as GSC precursors. However, we know little about how the size of the GSC precursor pool is regulated.</p><p>The timing and location of gametogenesis is controlled by the somatic environment of the PGCs. Somatic stromal cells called intermingled cells (ICs) contact PGCs in the center of the larval ovary, called the germ cell/IC (GC/IC) region, and maintain PGCs in an undifferentiated, proliferating state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113423-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0113423-King1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the mid&#x02013;third larval instar stage, a temporal signal delivered by the steroid hormone ecdysone activates a signaling pathway in the somatic cells that triggers niche formation and initiation of GSC establishment, as well as the induction of PGC differentiation via the direct gametogenesis pathway, in the late third larval instar stage (LL3) <xref rid="pone.0113423-Gancz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The somatic environment also controls spatial aspects of direct gametogenesis. PGC differentiation does not initiate uniformly throughout LL3 ovaries; rather, differentiating PGCs are located mostly in the posterior part of the GC/IC region, whereas PGCs in the anterior region remain undifferentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113423-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0113423-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This difference in PGC behavior along the anterior&#x02013;posterior axis of the ovary likely results from a locally produced diffusible morphogen, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP2/4 homologue). This factor is produced by the anterior somatic cells <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and is received by the anteriorly located PGCs, protecting them from gametogenesis by repressing the transcription of a differentiation gene, <italic>bag of marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>). By contrast, posterior PGCs fail to receive Dpp, and therefore permit <italic>bam</italic> expression and initiate differentiation <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113423-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. At the white pupal stage (WP), when GSC niche formation is complete (as evidenced by the appearance of cap cells), some of the anterior PGCs are accommodated in this niche and start asymmetric division as GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113423-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0113423-Asaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-King1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, it is the shape of the Dpp signaling gradient that determines the size of the GSC precursor pool by protecting PGCs from the global differentiation signal ecdysone. Artificially induced excess PGC differentiation at the onset of gametogenesis results in a decrease or absence of GSCs in the adult GSC niche, underscoring the importance of regulation of PGC pool size <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0113423-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113423.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Gone early, a non-peptidase homologue of Neprilysin metalloendopeptidases, is expressed in germline cells of LL3 ovaries.</title><p>(A) Key stages of PGC development.

Goe was not distributed evenly on the germ cell plasma membrane, but was localized to sub-compartments of the membrane where neighboring germ cells face each other.

The level of EGFR signaling, which is activated evenly among ICs, defines the number of ICs expressing the cell-surface proteoglycan Dally, which is required for Dpp movement from the signaling source; in addition, Dally stabilizes Dpp <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Akiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Fujise1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The number of ICs expressing Dally directly reflects the expansion of the Dpp signaling area <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, the size of the PGC pool in LL3 ovaries is defined by the level of EGFR signaling in the somatic stromal environment. However, it remains unknown whether germ cells also actively participate in this process.</p><p>Here we show that germ cells express a novel integral membrane protein, Gone early (Goe), which contributes to the regulation of PGC pool size.

Many previous studies have shown that such PGC fate decisions are primarily dependent on somatic stromal environment <xref rid="pone.0113423-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Gilboa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113423-Sheng1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Here, we propose that germ cells also contribute to the decision-making mechanism. We present genetic evidence that Goe on germ cell plasma membranes, acting cooperatively with an antagonist of EGFR signaling on stromal ICs, limits PGC differentiation and thereby secures the absolute number of GSCs. Goe could potentially act cell-autonomously to regulate PGC differentiation in a dose dependent fashion. However, we did not find indications that Goe expression levels differ between PGCs and differentiating germ cells; instead, Goe was expressed at comparable levels in all germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113423-g001">Figure 1C&#x02013;F</xref>). We thus hypothesize that rather than having a direct effect on PGC decision-making, Goe accelerates down-regulation of EGFR signaling on ICs in the entire GC/IC region, and the resultant low level of EGFR signaling limits the proportion of PGCs starting gametogenesis; the low level of EGFR signaling maintained by Goe increases the frequency of Dally-expressing ICs throughout the entire GC/IC region, and this in turn enhances the posterior diffusion of Dpp and expands the undifferentiated PGC pool posteriorly <xref rid="pone.0113423-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This idea is supported by the potential role of Goe as an antagonist of EGFR signaling and the synergistic interaction between <italic>goe</italic> and <italic>argos</italic> in suppressing PGC differentiation.</p><p>Goe was not uniformly distributed on the germ cell plasma membrane, but was instead localized to a domain of the membrane at the interface between germ cells. This is the first demonstration that the membrane domain at the interface between germ cells has a different molecular context than other regions of the germ cell membrane. Because <italic>goe</italic> is required to limit PGC differentiation, this observation suggests that the Goe-bounded membrane domain at the interface between germ cells is the site of cell&#x02013;cell communication that is essential for prevention of PGC differentiation. Such communication may take place between neighboring germ cells. However, given that IC processes frequently penetrate into germ cell interfaces, we favor the possibility that Goe mediates communication between germ cell&#x02013;IC processes at interfaces between germ cells.</p><p>Goe is essential for preventing a shift of the germ cell population to direct gametogenesis, but is dispensable for reconstitution of the PGC pool by dedifferentiation. We propose that Goe suppresses the allocation of PGCs to direct gametogenesis, thereby securing the fraction of &#x02018;naive GSCs&#x02019; that have never experienced dedifferentiation during development. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, GSCs that have experienced dedifferentiation can function as stem cells, but exhibit a high frequency of centrosome misorientation and divide less frequently. The accumulation of such GSCs is one cause of the age-related decline in gamete production <xref rid="pone.0113423-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.
