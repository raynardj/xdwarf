Grade IV astrocytoma, known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a highly lethal disease where the standard therapies of surgery, followed by radiation and chemotherapy, cannot significantly prolong the life expectancy of the patients. Tumour recurrence shows more aggressive form compared to the primary tumour, and results in patient survival from 12 to 15 months only. Although still controversial, the cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates that cancer stem cells are responsible for early relapse of the disease after surgical intervention due to their high resistance to therapy. Alternative strategies for GBM therapy are thus urgently needed. Nanobodies are single-domain antigen-binding fragments of heavy-chain antibodies, and together with classical antibodies, they are part of the camelid immune system. Nanobodies are small and stable, and they share a high degree of sequence identity to the human heavy chain variable domain, and these characteristics offer them advantages over classical antibodies or antibody fragments. We first immunised an alpaca with a human GBM stem-like cell line prepared from primary GBM cultures. Next, a nanobody library was constructed in a phage-display vector. Using nanobody phage-display technology, we selected specific GBM stem-like cell binders through a number of affinity selections, using whole cell protein extracts and membrane protein-enriched extracts from eight different GBM patients, and membrane protein-enriched extracts from two established GBM stem-like cell lines (NCH644 and NCH421K cells). After the enrichment, periplasmic extract ELISA was used to screen for specific clones. These nanobody clones were recloned into the pHEN6 vector, expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> WK6, and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Specific nanobody:antigen pairs were obtained and mass spectrometry analysis revealed two proteins, TRIM28 and &#x003b2;-actin, that were up-regulated in the GBM stem-like cells compared to the controls.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by P1-0104: Research Programme Grant from the Slovenian Scientific Agency (ARRS: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arrs.gov.si">https://www.arrs.gov.si</ext-link>) research grant to RK; INTERREG EC Project 2011, Ref.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are Grade IV astrocytomas that are relatively rare, but are still the most widespread and highly lethal form of glioma. These affect from 5 to 7 out of 100,000 people in the European Union <xref rid="pone.0113688-Crocetti1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, whereas over 10,000 new patients are diagnosed in the USA and Europe annually <xref rid="pone.0113688-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The American Brain Tumour Association has estimated that brain tumours are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under the age of 20 years and in males aged below 40 years <xref rid="pone.0113688-Association1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> with the incidence of GBM increasing with age from 30 years onwards <xref rid="pone.0113688-McKinney1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Despite all the research performed in this field, patients suffering from GBM currently have survival prognoses from 12 to 15 months <xref rid="pone.0113688-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, whereas those suffering from recurrent GBM have survival of about 6 months <xref rid="pone.0113688-Gruber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The standard treatment involves surgical resection, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. However, the blood&#x02013;brain barrier represents a specific problem in the treatment of brain tumours, as it generally prevents the passage of molecules greater than 500 Da into the brain <xref rid="pone.0113688-Daga1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This thus puts serious restrictions on the use of chemotherapy, although a number of clinical trials employing more targeted treatments have been carried out with the hope of improving GBM patients' outcomes <xref rid="pone.0113688-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113688-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The discovery of heavy-chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) in camelids in the early 1990s <xref rid="pone.0113688-HamersCasterman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> appears to have opened a new window of opportunity in the field of targeted treatment approaches. Due to the absence of the light polypeptide chains, HCAbs represent fully functional antigen-binding fragments that are comprised of one single domain only, known as the variable domain of the heavy chain of HCAbs (VHH) or nanobody. Nanobodies are small in size (<italic>ca</italic>. 2.5 nm in diameter, and <italic>ca</italic>. 4 nm long) <xref rid="pone.0113688-HassanzadehGhassabeh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, stable even at elevated temperatures <xref rid="pone.0113688-ArbabiGhahroudi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and non-physiological pH, and can be easily produced by recombinant technology. These properties make them suitable to monitor tumour biomarkers and to design improved diagnostic approaches. The high degree of sequence identity to human heavy chain variable domains (VHs) <xref rid="pone.0113688-Ebrahimizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> suggests their lower immunogenicity when applied as therapeutics.</p><p>We used a phage-displayed VHH library constructed from lymphocyte mRNA from a South American camel (llama) immunized with whole human GBM cells enriched in GBM stem-like cells.

After the enrichment, i.e. immunoaffinity selection, bacterial periplasmic extract was used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (pe-ELISA) for selecting nanobodies specific for GBM proteins. Upon incubation of these nanobodies with a protein mix from GBM stem-like cell lines, the captured cognate antigens were then identified by mass spectrometry (MS).

Nanobodies have a low molecular weight (14 kDa) <xref rid="pone.0113688-Muyldermans3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and they are small, very stable (they can be stored for months at 4&#x000b0;C, and even longer at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C), and are resistant to thermal and chemical denaturation <xref rid="pone.0113688-Dumoulin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Their size and shape allow them to recognize sites that are hidden or cryptic for interactions with classical antibodies. Above all, the immunization step of camelids and the cloning of the repertoire of the nanobodies, each nanobody as a single exon of about 350 bp gives access to <italic>in vivo,</italic> affinity matured target specific binders. In contrast, immunization of all other species necessitates the separate cloning of the VH and VL repertoires that in a subsequent step are joined randomly in a scFv of Fab construct whereby the original affinity matured VH-VL pairs become most likely scrambled. Hence, it is more difficult to retrieve stable high affinity binders from such libraries. In addition, the sequence similarity with human VH and their rapid blood clearance are predictive of low immunogenicity. Indeed, immune responses have never been detected in mice injected with nanobody constructs <xref rid="pone.0113688-CortezRetamozo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The major reason why they were chosen for possible therapeutic approaches for brain tumours is the presence of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, which limits the traffic to and from the brain. Nanobodies have been reported able to cross the blood-brain barrier and penetrate into brain cells <xref rid="pone.0113688-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although the capillaries of the glial tumours are more leaky than normal brain capillaries <xref rid="pone.0113688-Abbott1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, only a small percentage of drugs can pass through the blood&#x02013;brain barrier at pharmacologically significant levels <xref rid="pone.0113688-Caljon1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Up to now, there are a number of diseases such as depression, epilepsy and chronic pain, for which therapies with small molecules proved efficient, but unfortunately in this respect cancer has not been studied to any great extent <xref rid="pone.0113688-Pardridge1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>We aimed to identify nanobodies directed against novel biomarkers, specific for GBM stem-like cells that would prove valuable in diagnostics and, in the future, as therapeutics. Alpaca immunization was performed with whole glioma cells to elicit preferentially an immune response against the cell-surface proteins. During the nanobody library construction, the agarose gel after the first PCR of the animal lymphocyte cDNA showed two separate bands that corresponded to the two antibody types in camelids, the upper band of around 900 bp indicating the presence of heavy chain of classical antibodies, whereas the lower band, around 600 bp, was indicative of the heavy chain of HCAbs. The noted 300-bp size difference corresponds to the presence of the CH1 domain in the classical antibodies, which is absent in the HCAbs <xref rid="pone.0113688-Muyldermans2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. After a nested PCR using the 600 bp DNA fragments as template to amplify the VHHs only, ligation to phage display vectors, transformation into electro-competent cells and plating on selective petri dishes, yielded a nanobody library of some 10<sup>8</sup> individual transformants, which is consistent with the average size of recombinant VHH immune libraries <xref rid="pone.0113688-Azzazy1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The insert in the pHEN4 plasmid from 30 randomly chosen <italic>E. coli</italic> clones of this library was amplified by PCR, which showed that 80% of the clones had an insert in their pHEN4 vector with the size of a nanobody gene.</p><p>Bio-panning (i.e., immunoaffinity selection) is most successful when using a purified antigen immobilized on immunotubes or wells of microtitre plates. When using a complex sample like a protein extract from a tissue, the selection can be particularly difficult due to a limited amount of specific antigens in the sample. In addition, an enrichment of antibodies with specificity for non-relevant antigens may also occur. However, our selection was performed on a very heterogeneous panel of antigens (total protein extract and membrane protein-enriched extract from GBM tissues, and membrane protein-enriched extract from GBM stem-like cells) as we aimed to target a broader spectrum of novel antigens.</p><p>A large number of colonies from different rounds of panning were screened for all of the samples. The best results were obtained from the panning and screening of the membrane protein-enriched fractions from the GBM stem-like cell lines. It is possible that these cell lines provide a more homogeneous biological sample, whereas besides tumour-cell proteins, the tissue extracts may have also contained blood vessels and other constituents of the tumour stroma, present also in the healthy tissue. Periplasmic extract ELISA (i.e., an ELISA with periplasmic proteins from bacteria) was the preferred analysis method, because the nanobodies cloned in pHEN4 have a PelB signalling peptide at the N-terminus that transports these proteins to the bacterial periplasmic region <xref rid="pone.0113688-Skerra1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113688-Skerra2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In this way, most of the cytosolic proteins were avoided and the chance for false-positive signals was reduced. The HA-tag at the C-terminus of the periplasmic-expressed nanobody was used for the ELISA detection. From a number of nanobodies that displayed good ELISA signals, only three (named as Nb138, Nb141, Nb237) had amino-acid sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113688-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which clearly showed that all three domains are derived from a HCAb. The framework 2 region of Nb237 has the imprint of a VHH with F42 and R50. The C52 is surprising, although we expect that it will not lead to disulphide bond formation, as the amino acid in this position is normally covered by the long CDR3 loop. The framework 2 regions of the two other clones share a VH imprint with V42, L50 and W52. However, the R118 clearly indicates that also this domain cannot associate with a VL domain, and therefore they should originate from a HCAb as well. The CDR3 sequences of these two molecules are identical, and this predicts that they may target the same epitope <xref rid="pone.0113688-DeGenst1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The amino-acid differences between these clones in their CDR2 regions indicate that their affinities might be different, or that their binding to the target might be affected differentially by post-translational modifications of the antigen.</p><fig id="pone-0113688-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113688.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sequences of the nanobodies that were chosen for the large-scale production.</title><p>The amino acid sequence of the CDR3 regions of the nanobodies is given in alphabetic order.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0113688.g002"/></fig><p>These three nanobodies (Nb138, Nb141, Nb237) were chosen for large-scale production. The recloning into pHEN6 was necessary to introduce the His tag, which allows for their purification through IMAC (see Materials and methods) prior to the use of a size-exclusion chromatography step. This way purified nanobody fractions were pooled and applied to 12% SDS-PAGE. Staining with Coomassie blue revealed the presence of a single protein band at the expected molecular weight (14 kDa) for a nanobody.</p><p>These nanobodies were then used to capture antigens from a heterogeneous protein extract, which were then sent for MS analysis. This MS analysis identified two antigens, TRIM28 and &#x003b2;-actin, specific for Nb237 and Nb141, respectively. The third nanobody (Nb138) yielded inconclusive spectra. As stated above, Nb138 and Nb141 have the same CDR3 sequence, which suggests they would bind to the same antigen <xref rid="pone.0113688-DeGenst1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. As the target antigen for Nb138 could not be identified with MS, this means that the differences in the CDR2 regions between these two nanobodies (Nb138 and Nb141) might lead to a too low antigen capturing capacity for Nb138. Both of the antigens identified, TRIM28 and &#x003b2;-actin, belong to the group of internal cellular proteins and are discussed separately below. Identifying internal cellular proteins after selecting on membrane protein-enriched fractions may also be a result of an incomplete separation between the membrane protein-enriched and cytosolic fractions from the samples. Western blot analysis of the extracted protein samples showed the presence of cytosolic fractions in all of the samples. The signal from the membrane protein-enriched fractions was significantly stronger in the corresponding protein samples when compared to the cytosolic fractions originating from the same biological samples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113688.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Alpaca immunization was carried out with whole glioblastoma cells enriched in GBM stem-like cells, to raise antibodies against cell-surface markers. Yet, our data show that from the immune library, after phage display selections on GBM lysates, we were only able to retrieve nanobodies that recognise intracellular proteins. This might be due to the lower stability of the membrane proteins in the blood and/or the lysis of the glioma cells inside the alpaca during the course of the immunization.

To date, about 70 members of the TRIM family are known. Their structures were explained in detail by Micale <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113688-Micale1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. TRIM proteins vary in the number of B-boxes and the C-terminal domain. Indeed, the TRIM family can be subdivided into 11 different groups based on the composition of the highly variable C-terminal region. The 6<sup>th</sup> subfamily of the TRIM proteins, due to the presence of C-terminal BROMO and PHD domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113688-g005">Figure 5</xref>), consists of three TIF1 members, TIF1&#x003b1;, TIF1&#x003b2;, TIF1&#x003b3;, which are also known as TRIM24, TRIM28 and TRIM33, respectively, and found to display high sequence homology. Their well-conserved PHD and BROMO domains were found widely distributed among nuclear proteins acting at the chromatin level and involved in the control of gene expression through regulation of the transcriptional activity of numerous sequence-specific transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0113688-Aasland1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113688-Cammas1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0113688-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> hypothesised that in the early stages of lung adenocarcinomas, the levels of TRIM28 are up-regulated for protective reasons; i.e., to control cell growth and suppress tumour development. More recently, Liu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113688-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> reported that TRIM28 is a possible marker for the detection of circulating cancer cells, and provided evidence for a role for TRIM28 in metastasis development and prognosis in early stage non&#x02013;small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, 35 of 48 patients with NSCLC had overexpressed <italic>TRIM28</italic> mRNA levels, while the rest of these showed underexpressed <italic>TRIM28</italic> mRNA levels, compared to non-cancerous tissue. Liu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113688-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> thus proposed that TRIM28 might be involved in tumour-cell migration, and tumour invasion and progression. Even though the findings of Liu <italic>et al.</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0113688-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> are contradictory, as lung cancers are the cause for the occurrence of 65% secondary GBMs <xref rid="pone.0113688-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, the correlation of TRIM28 to GBM shown in the present study is an interesting discovery that deserves further being investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>&#x003b2;-actin as a tumour marker</title><p>&#x003b2;-actin is a highly abundant cytoskeletal protein spread throughout the peripheral cell regions and the leading edges of motile cells.

<xref rid="pone.0113688-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> showed that &#x003b2;-actin is localised in the pseudopodia of invasive cells, but absent in non-invasive cells. These data are further supported by the studies of Nowak <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113688-Nowak1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113688-Nowak2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> and Popow <italic>et al.</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0113688-Panopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> demonstrated that GBM cells can show exceptional motility that can even occur in the absence of polymerised actin.
