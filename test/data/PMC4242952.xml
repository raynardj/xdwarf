exercise and elastic-resistance exercise program on muscle strength and balance of the
old-old elderly (over the age of 75). [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-five elderly persons
were recruited from the community and assigned to three groups for convenience: balance
exercise (intervention group 1; INT 1), resistance exercise (intervention group 2; INT 2),
and control (CON) groups. The intervention was performed twice a week at a senior center
and three times a week at home for 8 weeks. Muscle strength and balance were evaluated
before and at the end of the trial, using a PowertrackIIand Tetrax. [Results] There were
significant improvements in the strength of all seven muscle groups and balance in the INT
2 group. In the INT 1 group, there were significant improvements in the strength of all
muscle groups except for the knee flexor and ankle plantar flexor muscle groups.
[Conclusion] This study demonstrated that an intervention using balance exercises or
elastic-resistance exercises is effective at improving the muscle strength and balance of
the old-old elderly. These type of exercises should be appropriate for the physical
characteristics of the subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Falls</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd><kwd>Postural balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The elderly have at least a 10 times higher risk of falling than other age groups because
of age-related physiological changes, especially those pertaining to the quality and
quantity of skeletal muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thirty to
fifty percent of the elderly over 65&#x02005;years of age experience falls every year<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physical damage from falls may include
bruising, hematoma, fractures, and even brain damage or other secondary complications, and
decreasing physiological functions and weakening muscles may lead to other falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although falls may not necessarily lead to
extreme physical damage, they may restrict daily activities because of long-term pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the elderly, the high-risk factors of
falls are loss of muscle strength and balance instability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, fall-prevention
exercises for the elderly consist of lower extremity resistance exercises and balance
training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There is currently a need for a specialized fall-prevention program that considers the
special characteristics of elderly persons in their 80s, because existing programs are not
effective enough for this high-risk group<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Newman and Newman<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>
argued that fall-prevention programs focusing on physical abilities are not highly effective
because the elderly over the age of 75 show a rapid decrease in instrumental activities of
daily living compared with elderly persons between aged 60 to 74&#x02005;years of age. After
measuring and comparing the strength differences among different age groups, Lamoureux et
al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that people&#x02019;s strength
weakens as they age. This occurs rapidly after the age of 75, when serious muscle weakening
in the lower extremities begins. Rogers et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that the frequency of falls actually increases over the
age of 75. However, the old-old elderly (over the age of 75) have little opportunity to
participate in regular physical activities, which makes it harder for them to increase their
physical activity and strength<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
people age, there is a higher chance of death because of complications and falls and less
chance of recovery<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, an
intervention for fall prevention is needed to increase the balance and strength of the
old-old elderly.</p><p>Purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of balance exercise and
elastic-resistance exercise programs on the muscle strength and balance of the old-old
elderly in order to suggest an effective intervention for fall prevention for this
population, who are at the highest risk of falls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixty elderly persons over the age of 75 who lived in the community were chosen by
convenience sampling as participants for this study. They gave their written informed
consent to participation in the study after the experimental procedures had been
explained. The study was approved by the Inje University Faculty of Health Science Human
Ethics Committee. Subjects were excluded if they had neurological impairments, severe
cardiovascular diseases, persistent joint pain, or musculoskeletal impairment; required
assistance from another person or a device during ambulation; scored lower than 24 on the
Mini-Mental State Examination (Korean version); or were on medication that affected
balance. Subjects who were already involved in other exercise programs were also excluded
from this study.</p><p>To prevent the diffusion of the experiment&#x02019;s intervention, three senior citizen centers
that were far from one another were chosen, and 20 participants were chosen from each
center. Four participants dropped out from the intervention group 1 (INT 1 group), one
dropped out from the intervention group 2 (INT 2 group), and none dropped out from the
control (CON) group. Therefore, the final number of the participants was 55. Their general

ankle dorsiflexors, and ankle plantar flexors was measured using a hand-held dynamometer
(Powertrack II, JTECH Medical). Strength was measured directly by the experimenter to
prevent intertester error. The participants were explained the procedure of each
measurement and performed one trial for each. Then, three measurements were taken and the
average value was calculated. To find the interrater reliability for each muscle, the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of each muscle strength measurement was
calculated, and the values ranged from 0.97 to 0.99. The fall index, which evaluates the
risk of falls, was calculated using a Tetrax (Sunlight Medical Ltd., Israel) to measure
balance. The balance index ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher
risk of falls.</p><p>The INT 1 group performed balance exercises and the INT 2 group performed
elastic-resistance exercises in 1-hour sessions five times a week for 8 weeks, a total of
40 sessions. The experimenters conducted the group exercises two times a week at the
senior citizen centers, and the individuals performed the exercises at home, by
themselves, three times a week. All 1-hour sessions consisted of 10 minutes of warm-up and
stretching, 40 minutes of main exercise, and 10 minutes of cool down. The exercises were
conducted in 3 sets, with 10 repetitions per set, and there was a 30-second rest period
between each set and a 3- to 5-minute rest period between each exercise. A safety device
was employed to prevent falls during the exercises. The CON group performed the exercises
after the 8-week intervention period had ended.</p><p>The balance exercises consisted of six types of exercise: side stepping, tandem walking,
retro walking, braiding, one-leg stance with cup tapping, and external perturbation while
standing with the head up and back straight. The elastic-resistance exercises consisted of
eight types of exercise: squats, heel raise, hip flexion/extension, knee
flexion/extension, and ankle plantar/dorsiflexion. Resistance was provided by Thera-Bands
(Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA) and the intensity and frequency of the exercises
were chosen following to previous studies (e.g., Zion et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>). Red and yellow elastic bands were chosen at the
appropriate level for the seniors. The level of the bands was gradually raised, and it was
also raised during the last set when a participant was able to perform the actions without
much difficulty. The exercises were conducted slowly so that concentric and eccentric
contraction would occur accurately.</p><p>The collected data were statistically processed using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used as a homogeneity test of
the muscle strengths and balance abilities of the INT 1, INT 2, and CON groups. The paired
t-test was used to examine the differences between the pretest and posttest values of
balance and muscle strength to determine the program&#x02019;s effectiveness. Also, ANOVA was used
to assess the significance of differences among the populations of the INT 1, INT 2, and
CON groups. Bonferroni adjusted post hoc tests were conducted to identify the comparisons
that were statistically significant. Significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.01.
The ICC was calculated to test the reliability of the equipment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The homogeneity test for the muscle strength and fall index values of the INT 1, INT 2, and
CON groups before the intervention found no significant differences among the three groups.
The INT 1 group showed statistically significant improvements in muscle strength in five
muscle groups: hip flexor (t = &#x02212;5.21, p &#x0003c; 0.001), hip extensor (t = &#x02212;3.57, p = 0.003),
hip abductor (t = &#x02212;6.52, p &#x0003c; 0.001), knee extensor (t = &#x02212;6.79, p &#x0003c; 0.001), and ankle
dorsiflexor (t = &#x02212;4.28, p = 0.001). The strengths of the knee flexor (t = &#x02212;1.78, p = 0.096)
and ankle plantar flexor (t = &#x02212;1.67, p = 0.115) improved after the intervention, but without
significant difference. The INT 2 group showed statistically significant improvements in the
strengths of all the muscle groups tested: hip flexor (t = &#x02212;5.12, p &#x0003c; 0.001), hip
extensor (t = &#x02212;3.55, p = 0.002), hip abductor (t = &#x02212;5.11, p &#x0003c; 0.001), knee flexor (t =
&#x02212;3.67, p = 0.002), knee extensor (t = &#x02212;12.27, p &#x0003c; 0.001), ankle dorsiflexor (t = &#x02212;7.93, p
&#x0003c; 0.001), and ankle plantar flexor (t = &#x02212;6.05, p &#x0003c; 0.001). After the intervention, the
fall index score of the INT 1 group decreased from 59.0 (22.0) to 44.5 (17.4), a
statistically significant decrease (t = 5.77, p &#x0003c; 0.001). The INT 2 group also showed a
statistically significant decrease in the fall index score from 62.5 (24.9) to 41.9 (23.7).
However, the CON group showed no significant differences in the strengths of any muscle
group or in the fall index after 8 weeks.</p><p>ANOVA of the differences between the pretest and posttest mean values of the INT 1, INT 2,
and CON groups found significant differences for all seven muscle groups and balance ability
among the three groups. The post hoc test, further revealed that the INT 1 group showed
statistically significant improvements in the hip flexor, hip extensor, hip abductor, knee
extensor, and ankle dorsiflexor muscles, and the fall index compared to the pre-post mean
difference of the CON group. The INT 2 group showed statistically significant improvements
in all seven types of muscles and the fall index compared to the CON group. The INT 2 group
showed a significant mean difference in the ankle plantar flexor muscle compared to the INT
1 group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of balance exercise and
elastic-resistance exercise programs on the muscle strength and balance of the old-old
elderly. The INT 1 group showed a statistically significant improvement in muscle strengths
of five of seven muscle groups, but not those of the knee flexors and ankle plantar flexors.
Compared to the mean muscle strengths of the CON group, after the balance exercises, the INT
1 group showed statistically significant improvements in the strengths of the five muscle
groups. After conducting balance exercises for seniors over the age of 65, Kim and
Lockhart<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an improvement in
muscle strength and gait and concluded that balance exercises contributes to fall
prevention.</p><p>The INT 2 group showed a statistically significant improvement in the strength of all seven
muscle groups after the intervention. In the comparison of mean muscle strengths with those
of the CON group, after the resistance exercises, the INT 2 group showed significant
improvements in the strengths of all seven muscle groups. This result is in accordance with
the results of Zion et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, who
conducted elastic-resistance exercises over the course of 8 weeks for the elderly and found
that muscle strength and balance showed statistically significant improvements. Kim and
Lockhart<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the ankle
plantar flexor and knee extensor strengths of 18 older adults improved after performance of
elastic-resistance exercises for 8 weeks. As people age, the risk of fall increases because
a decrease muscle mass leads to atrophy, which decreases muscle function<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strengthening exercises using elastic
resistance are practical because they have only a small risk of injury, provide consistent
tension, and are easily portable and inexpensive. Elastic-resistance exercises help not only
in rehabilitation but also in other areas because they have been proven to improve muscle
strength and stability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The INT 1 and INT 2 groups showed significant improvements in balance after the
intervention, which proves that both balance exercises and resistance exercises are
effective at improving balance. In the posttest comparison of the mean differences in
balance among the three groups, no difference was found between the INT 1 and INT 2 groups,
but both groups showed significant improvements in comparison with the CON group.
Age-related balance deficits may occur because of increased postural sway caused by weakness
of leg muscles and decreased proprioception<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The balance exercises and elastic-resistance exercises conducted
for 8 weeks improved leg muscle strength and proprioception of the neuromuscular system
through muscle contraction and stimulation of proprioceptive sense. Lee and Park<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that improvement in the strength
of the lower extremities enhances the balance of the elderly. We assume that the improvement
in balance observed in the present study resulted from the improvement seen in the strength
of the lower limbs.</p><p>Unlike previous studies that have reported fall-prevention exercises to be ineffective for
the old-old elderly<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, our results show that balance exercises and elastic-resistance
exercises were effective at improving the muscle strength and balance of this population.
Skelton and Beyer<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that there
are limits to the effectiveness of fall-prevention exercises for the old-old elderly, and
noted that one-on-one approaches for the elderly are more effective than group exercises. In
our study, the intervention was conducted for the old-old elderly, who have a rapid aging
process, and thus are the most vulnerable to falls. Our results show there were improvements
in both the balance exercise and resistance exercise groups after 8 weeks. Although the
elastic-resistance exercises proved to be more effective than the balance exercises at
strengthening the ankle plantar flexors, there was not a big difference in the effectiveness
of the two exercise types; thus, we conclude that both types of exercise are acceptable as
fall-prevention exercises for the old-old elderly. We also suggest that these exercises be
used appropriately according to personal physical characteristics and needs. Because of the
physical characteristics of the elderly, fall-prevention exercises should not pose injury
risks, and should be easy to practice, even at home. The balance exercises and
elastic-resistance exercises used in the present study are accessible to the elderly,
because they do not need specialized equipment and can be adjusted to personal physical
strength.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that the group exercises with the researcher were conducted
for only 2 of the 5 intervention days per week, leaving 3 days per week for the elderly to
perform the exercises by themselves. This made it difficult to control the intervention
perfectly. The significance of this study is that it revealed that balance exercises and
elastic-resistance exercises are effective at fall prevention for the old-old elderly, who
are at high risk of falls because of rapid aging. Therefore, such exercises are suggested
for fall prevention programs for this particular population.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The connection between drugs and falls in
