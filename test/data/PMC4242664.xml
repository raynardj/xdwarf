The accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; is mainly caused by hypoxia or through the mutated succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA) or fumarate hydratase (FH) expression to inhibit its degradation. However, its activation under normoxic conditions, termed pseudohypoxia, in cells without mutated SDHA or FH is not well documented. Here, we show that dimethyl-2-ketoglutarate (DKG), a cell membrane-permeable precursor of a key metabolic intermediate, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;-KG), known for its ability to rescue glutamine deficiency, transiently stabilized HIF-1&#x003b1; by inhibiting activity of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein, PHD2. Consequently, prolonged DKG-treatment under normoxia elevated HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance and up-regulated the expression of its downstream target genes, thereby inducing a pseudohypoxic condition. This HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization phenotype is similar to that from treatment of cells with desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, or dimethyloxalyglycine (DMOG), an established PHD inhibitor, but was not recapitulated with other &#x003b1;-KG analogues, such as Octyl-2KG, MPTOM001 and MPTOM002. Our study is the first example of an &#x003b1;-KG precursor to increase HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance and activity. We propose that DKG acts as a potent HIF-1&#x003b1; activator, highlighting the potential use of DKG to investigate the contribution of PHD2-HIF-1&#x003b1; pathway to tumor biology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by National Institutes of Health Research Grants R01DE10742 and R01DE14183 and The Mary Kay Foundation Research Grant number 005-13 (to D.K.A.).

<xref rid="pone.0113865-Semenza2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and references therein). The stability of the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein is tightly controlled by O<sub>2</sub> availability. Under normoxia, both proline (Pro)402 and Pro564 located at the O<sub>2</sub>-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1&#x003b1; are hydroxylated in the presence of ascorbate, alpha-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;-KG) or Fe(II) by the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-containing proteins <xref rid="pone.0113865-Schofield1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-KaelinJr1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex recognizes HIF-1&#x003b1; with either proline hydroxylated, leading to HIF-1&#x003b1; ubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome <xref rid="pone.0113865-Jaakkola1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. PHD2 is the most abundant HIF prolyl hydroxylase for HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Berra1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Bubendorf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Mutations of respective proline located within the N- and C-terminal ODD domain showed approximately equal amounts of increased stability and reduced up-regulation in hypoxia. If both prolines are substituted, HIF-1&#x003b1; shows further increase in stability and no induction in hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0113865-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Masson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In cell culture, HIF-1&#x003b1; proline-hydroxylation is inhibited by lower O<sub>2</sub> tension (below 6%, termed as hypoxia). Under hypoxic condition, the activity of PHD is restricted, thereby inhibiting HIF-1&#x003b1; hydroxylation and degradation <xref rid="pone.0113865-KaelinJr1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Consequently, induced expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; downstream target genes, including <italic>GLUT-1</italic>, <italic>PDK1 and CAIX</italic>, provides survival advantages to tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0113865-Semenza3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Alternatively, loss-of-function mutations in pVHL or the enzymes involved in the metabolism of PHD cofactors cause the accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; in cancers. For example, sporadic renal cell carcinoma with mutations or deletions of <italic>VHL</italic> gene exhibits elevated HIF-1&#x003b1; levels <xref rid="pone.0113865-Pugh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH) are the enzymes that hydrolyze succinate and fumarate, respectively, to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mutations in SDH or FH are found in cancers and cause succinate or fumarate to accumulate and compete with &#x003b1;-KG for PHD binding, thereby inhibiting PHD and stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0113865-Isaacs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Selak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Mutations have also been identified in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity in glioma, thereby reducing the production of &#x003b1;-KG, increasing HIF-1&#x003b1; and presumably, tumorigenesis <xref rid="pone.0113865-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, dysregulated cellular metabolome could up-regulate HIF-1&#x003b1; level and create a pseudohypoxic state under normoxia. Other factors also affect the amount of HIF-1&#x003b1; available for transcriptional activation. These include increased HIF-1&#x003b1; production by activated mTOR signaling <xref rid="pone.0113865-DelBufalo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and VHL-independent degradation by heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and carboxyl terminus of HSP-interaction protein (CHIP) <xref rid="pone.0113865-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Moreover, the availability of nutrients, such as glutamine (Gln) and glucose (Glc), also regulates the translation of HIF-1&#x003b1;. It has been shown that the decreased levels of Gln or Glc inhibit the translation of HIF-1&#x003b1;, thereby decreasing the level of HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0113865-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting that the fluctuation of metabolites could modulate HIF-1&#x003b1; activity and its downstream signaling to regulate cellular responses.</p><p>In the present study, we show that dimethyl-2-ketoglutarate (DKG), a precursor for &#x003b1;-KG, increases HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance and activity. We demonstrate that PHD2 is one of the potential targets for DKG to stabilize HIF-1&#x003b1;. Taken together, our studies identify DKG, unlike &#x003b1;-KG, acts to promote pseudohypoxia by promoting HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>All cell lines were cultured in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C.

We observed that DKG-treatment led to a decrease of phospho-p70S6K and total 4EBP1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Although this observation was consistent with a recent report showing that &#x003b1;-KG blocks mTOR activity through the inhibition of ATP synthase <xref rid="pone.0113865-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, it was unlikely that the down-regulation of mTOR signaling, hence the decreased mTOR-mediated protein synthesis, accounted for the elevated HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance upon DKG-treatment. To further rule out this possibility, we further revealed that DKG was still able to induce HIF-&#x003b1; accumulation, albeit to a lesser extent, upon Gln depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>lanes 5 and 6</italic> versus <italic>lane 4</italic>), a condition known to suppress HIF-1&#x003b1; translation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>lane 4</italic> versus <italic>lane 1</italic>). Based on these observations that DKG increased HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance without increasing <italic>HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic> steady-state mRNA level and without enhancing mTOR signaling, we hypothesized that DKG impaired the degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1;. To test this possibility, MDA-MB-231 cells were pre-treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor known to retard proteasome-dependent protein degradation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, to elevate HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance under normoxia, and then followed by the treatment of DKG or vehicle to assess HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance in the presence of MG132. We found that DKG had no additional effect on HIF-1&#x003b1; level when proteasome-dependent degradation was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), implicating that DKG and MG132 acted on the same pathway. To understand at which step DKG acted to inhibit HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation, we compared HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with a combination of DKG, dimethyloxalyglycine (DMOG), which inhibits HIF-1&#x003b1; hydroxylation, DFO and MG132. The levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; in cells undergoing different treatment were almost comparable, irrespective of the combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), further supporting that DKG, DMOG and DFO may all act in the same pathway to retard HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation. To ascertain this, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DKG, DMOG or both and HIF-1&#x003b1; levels were determined. DKG or DMOG alone increased HIF-1&#x003b1;, but combining them did not further elevate HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance, compared to the single treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). We therefore postulated that DKG and DMOG acted redundantly to increase HIF-1&#x003b1; stability. Collectively, these data supported a mechanism in which DKG blocked HIF-1&#x003b1; proteasomal degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>DKG inhibits HIF-1&#x003b1; proline hydroxylation and degradation mediated by PHD2</title><p>To explore how DKG impairs HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation, we next compared the HIF-1&#x003b1; half-life in cells in the presence and absence of DKG. First, cells were pre-treated with DKG for 2-hour to boost HIF-1&#x003b1; level, then incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein biosynthesis and treated or untreated with DKG. The half-life of HIF-1&#x003b1; induced by DKG was between 1- and 2-hour after DKG withdrawal, but continuous exposure to DKG prolonged the half-life of HIF-1&#x003b1; induced by DKG to longer than 2-hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The observation that DKG extended HIF-1&#x003b1; half-life further corroborated that DKG inhibits HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation. Because PHDs use &#x003b1;-KG as a cofactor to catalyze hydroxylation on the substrates, we then tested whether DKG stabilized HIF-1&#x003b1; through modulating the activity of PHDs. Under normoxia, knocking down PHD2, but not PHD1 or 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, <italic>lower panel</italic>), markedly increased HIF-1&#x003b1; abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>). This observation was consistent with the previous reports that HIF-1&#x003b1; stability was primarily regulated by PHD2 <xref rid="pone.0113865-Berra1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Tennant1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Notably, treatment of DKG did not further induce the accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; in the PHD2-knockdown cells, while HIF-&#x003b1; was still up-regulated by DKG in the PHD1 or PHD3-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>). Taken together, we concluded that DKG promoted HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation, at least in part, by inhibiting the PHD2-mediated HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation. Moreover, results from ODD-luciferase reporter assays supported that DKG directly inhibited PHD activity on the ODD hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Lastly, we used a specific antibody that recognized HIF-1&#x003b1; hydroxylated at Pro564 to determine the levels of hydroxylated HIF-1&#x003b1; when proteasomal degradation was inhibited by MG132. Treating the cells with DMOG, completely inhibited both the hydroxylation and ubiquitylation of HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, <italic>lane 2</italic> versus <italic>lane 1</italic>), and served as a control.

Given that PHD2 requires &#x003b1;-KG as a cofactor for function, we propose that DKG may be by itself or metabolized or processed (to other than &#x003b1;-KG) to inhibit PHD2 activity. For example, succinate and fumarate are the metabolites downstream of &#x003b1;-KG in TCA cycle, and both of them can inhibit PHD2 activity, either through competing with &#x003b1;-KG binding to PHD2, or by intercalating with glutathione to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref rid="pone.0113865-Isaacs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Selak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-SullivanLucas1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We suspect that DKG could be rapidly processed to succinate or fumarate under nutrient-rich conditions, thereby inhibiting PHD2. Another possibility is that the intracellular ROS levels, elevated under pseudohypoxia induced by DKG, lead to the HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization. Increased ROS has also been linked to PHD2 inhibition and HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Niecknig1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Guzy1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Indeed, the accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; induced by DKG was partially suppressed by pre-treating cells with N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger (data not shown).</p><p>Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1&#x003b1; is efficiently degraded. PHD2 is the major regulator controlling the degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0113865-Berra1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Tennant1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The regulation is complicated by the hypoxic induction of PHD2 and PHD3, and additional mechanisms to promote HIF accumulation may be required to prevent complete HIF degradation in the chronic hypoxic conditions found in tumors <xref rid="pone.0113865-Appelhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Of note, PHDs are not the only biological means for &#x003b1;-KG to inactivate HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0113865-KaelinJr1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For example, the oxygen-dependent hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF hydroxylates asparagine (Asn803) residue in the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1&#x003b1; in an &#x003b1;-KG-dependent manner, reducing the binding of HIF-1&#x003b1; to transcriptional co-activators <xref rid="pone.0113865-Mahon1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Additional regulatory modifications of the HIF-1&#x003b1; include SUMOylation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, acetylation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0113865-Flgel1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113865-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Although the effect of DKG on these HIF-1&#x003b1; post-translational modifications other than PHD2-dependent proline-hydroxylation and ubiquitylation remains to be investigated, it is clear that DKG activates HIF-1&#x003b1; signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113865-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study identifies DKG as a potent activator of HIF-1&#x003b1; by stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1; in a PHD2-dependent manner under both normoxia and hypoxia. HIF-1&#x003b1; is known to play a major role in tumorigenesis, through activation of several genes implicated in many aspects of cancer progression and prognosis <xref rid="pone.0113865-Semenza2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On the other hand, PHD2 has been shown to be down-regulated in human breast cancers <xref rid="pone.0113865-Bordoli1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Based on our results, we show that inhibition of PHD2 by DKG increases the expression of genes implicated in the glycolytic pathway (<italic>GLUT1</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic>), the mechanism known to play an important role in cancer progression. Hence, DKG could be a useful molecule allowing us to investigate DKG-PHD2-dependent regulation of specific HIF-1&#x003b1; target genes in order to better understand hypoxia signaling mechanisms and for the identification of new therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113865.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <bold>DKG does not up-regulate </bold>
