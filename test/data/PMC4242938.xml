ribs and upper pelvis. LBP, which is a term for overall pain related to the abnormal
structure of lumbar vertebrae, is one of the most common medical problems in modern
society<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sixty to 80% of adults complain of LBP, and first symptoms occur mainly in ages of
20&#x02013;39&#x02005;years. Once individuals are over 35&#x02005;years old, elasticity of ligaments and joints
around vertebrae is reduced and restricted, resulting in occurrence of lower back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic lower back pain is defined as the
LBP lasting over 3 months, and this pain could lead to social problems because treatment of
LBP has many costs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Some of the causes of the chronic LBP include excessive physical activities, muscle
weakness in abdominal lumbar region, improper working environment, and direct trauma. In
addition, some conditions such as long periods of sedentary lifestyle, abnormal posture,
excessive tension of muscle, and abdominal obesity can contribute abnormal contracture,
which leads to lower back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, increased kyphosis reduces the mobility of the trunk, and as a result, abnormal
movement of the lumbar vertebrae appears as a compensation movement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This abnormal movement makes the instability of facet
joints more severe, and then lower back pain easily occurs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although it is reported that manual therapy needs to be applied to the thorax of patients
with LBP, there is still lack of studies about increasing the stability of the lumbar region
by improving thoracic mobility, which results in a decrease in abnormal movement between
vertebrae. In addition, manipulation or mobilization were used separately in previous
studies about the effects of increased thoracic mobility in chronic LBP patients. Thus, it
has not been known which therapy is more effective. For this reason, the purpose of this
study was to evaluate the changes in function and mental state after thoracic mobilization
and manipulation in chronic lower back pain patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Out patient who suffered from chronic LBP for more than 12 weeks were recruited in this

methods was given and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study subjects
provided written informed consent prior to participation according to the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Oswestry disability index (ODI) was used to measure the functional impairment of
patients with LBP. The ODI is composed of 10 items, including pain level, private
sterilization, gait, sitting, standing, sleeping, sexual life, social activities and
travels. The sum of the scores is divided by the total score possible and then converted
into a percentage. A higher score indicates higher functional impairment.</p><p>A multiple spinal diagnosis device was used to measure the range of motion (ROM) of
vertebra segments. This device is used to measure the shape and mobility of vertebrae in
the sagittal plane. Measurement was performed with hip/knee joint at 90 degrees of
flexion, and subjects were instructed to maintain a neutral sitting position. The angle of
vertebra flexion and extension was then measured in full active flexion and full active
extension of the trunk. ROM measurements were repeated 3 times, and the mean value was
used for statistical analysis.</p><p>The fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) was used to investigate the mental state
of LBP patients. This questionnaire consists of 16 items and is divided into two subareas,
physical activity and work. Each item is scored from 0 to 6, and a high score demonstrates
increased fear-avoidance beliefs.</p><p>Group A was provided with trunk mobilization after sling Neurac exercise, and group B was
provided with trunk manipulation after sling Neurac exercise. Control group (group C)
performed only sling Neurac exercise. Each intervention was conducted 3 times a week for 6
weeks, and all measurements were performed before and after the intervention.</p><p>Group A was instructed to lie in a prone position with the thorax slightly flexed, and
then therapists applied grade 2&#x02013;3 mobilization to the subjects. Anteriorly directed
central gliding was applied to the segment with small movement of the facet joint after
palpating T5&#x02013;T12. Mobilization was performed for 60 seconds and repeated twice after
confirming the comfort of the subjects during the procedure.</p><p>Group B was instructed to lie in a supine position with their upper limbs crossed, and
then therapists put a hand on the vertebrae while the other hand supported the subject&#x02019;s
neck. The therapist&#x02019;s hand was placed on the pain region by flexing the trunk using the
subject&#x02019;s upper extremity, and looseness was eliminated by controlling the subject&#x02019;s
breath during expiration. Thrust was performed vertically. Manipulation was performed just
once on facet joints after palpating T5&#x02013;T12.</p><p>Group C performed only sling Neurac exercise for 30 minutes. Traction-relaxation exercise
was conducted for 5 minutes as a warm-up, and local muscle strengthening in a supine
lumbar setting was applied for 10 seconds, with 5 repetitions for a total of 3 sets. Gross
muscle strengthening in the form of the supine pelvic lift, side-lying hip abduction, and
side-lying hip abduction was respectively performed for 10 seconds, with 5 repetitions for
a total of 3 sets.</p><p>The result are shown as means&#x000b1;SD. PASW 18.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis
in this study, and homogeneity testing for general characteristics was performed using
one-way ANOVA. To analyze the differences between before and after the interventions, the
paired t-test was used. One-way ANOVA was also used to compare the differences between
groups, and post-hoc analysis was conducted using the LSD test. The significance level was
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was a significant change in ODI in all groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). There were significant

recurring diseases. LBP patients suffer from pain, a decrease in endurance and flexibility,
and limited ROM of the lumbar region. Furthermore, LBP patients have a lower balance
ability, resulting in some difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies, instability of the lumbar region was introduced as the most important
cause of lower back pain out of many factors<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Active exercise and manipulation therapy
are widely used to improve lumbar function and prevent recurrence<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar stabilization exercise is clinically applied to
treat lumbar instability. In addition, a therapeutic approach has already been introduced
that can reduce the stress on the lumbar region by applying joint mobility therapy to the
segments with lesser movement. That is, therapy including manipulation is a more effective
approach because exercise for the vertebrae alone would not resolve lower back pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the ODI was significantly decreased in all groups after intervention, and
the ODIs of groups A and B were more significantly decreased than that of the control group.
Ko<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in his study
comparing a mobilization group with a William exercise group, the ODI of the mobilization
group was more significantly decreased compared with that of the William exercise group.
This indicates that when thoracic mobilization is combined with lumbar exercise, the therapy
becomes more effective.</p><p>Deep muscles in the lumbar region of LBP patients are weaker than those of healthy adults
and reposition sense is decreased by reduced proprioception, resulting in instability of
vertebrae. Furthermore, vertebra movement becomes abnormal during flexion and extension of
the trunk, and abnormal coupling motion also occurs during lateral flexion of the trunk. The
more severe the spasticity of the thorax is, the more excessive movement in the cervical and
thoracic regions occurs<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the ROMs of flexion and extension were significantly increased in all
groups. Between groups, there was a significant difference only in the ROM of trunk
extension. The post-hoc analysis revealed that group A and B showed significant increases
compared with group C. Heo reported that an increase in thoracic mobility improved the
stability of the lumbar region by reducing the compensation movements in the lumbar region,
resulting in decreased pain and physical impairment<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, Kaltenborn reported lumbar stability could be
improved by relative control of segment movement<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Psychological factors are focused on as the cause of pain and chronicization related to the
musculoskeletal system. Fear-avoidance belief, one of the psychological factors, is an
activity in which patients avoid a movement because of fear of pain, and this can cause the
disease to become chronic and aggravate the physical symptoms. The existence of
fear-avoidance belief in chronic LBP patients should be considered, because it is helpful to
anticipate the results of therapy and prognosis of patients performing ADL<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, there was a significant decrease in FABQ only in B group. Between groups,
there was a statistically significant difference, and group B was more significantly
decreased than the control group. It is thought that reduction of pain and improvement of
ROM after thoracic manipulation would affect the patient&#x02019;s mental state.</p><p>Based on our findings, lumbar stabilization could be improved by thoracic mobilization and
thoracic manipulation, improving thoracic mobility. However, all measurements were not
significantly different between the mobilization group and manipulation group. Thus, when
lumbar stabilization exercise is combined with thoracic manual therapy, the increase in ODI,
FABQ, and ROM of trunk extension would be enhanced. Continuous application will be needed,
and treatment programs including interventions that can improve thoracic mobility are
expected to be widely used.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fourney</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Dettori</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A systematic review of clinical pathways for lower back
