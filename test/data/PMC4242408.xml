For years, tissue engineering approaches have been seeking a stable, axially vascularized transplantable bone replacement suitable for transplantation into the recipient bed with pre-existing insufficient conditions. For this reason, the arteriovenous loop model was developed and various bone substitutes have been vascularized. However, it has not been possible thus far to engineer a primary stable and axially vascularized transplantable bone substitute. For that purpose, a primary stable silica-embedded nanohydroxyapatite (HA) bone substitute in combination with blood, bone marrow, expanded, or directly retransplanted mesenchymal stem cells, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2), and different carrier materials (fibrin, cell culture medium, autologous serum) was tested subcutaneously for 4 or 12 weeks in the sheep model. Autologous serum lead to an early matrix change during degradation of the bone substitute and formation of new bone tissue. The best results were achieved in the group combining mesenchymal stem cells expanded with 60 &#x003bc;g/mL rhBMP-2 in autologous serum. Better ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue could be detected in the autologous serum group compared with the control (fibrin). Osteoclastic activity indicating an active bone remodeling process was observed after 4 weeks, particularly in the group with autologous serum and after 12 weeks in every experimental group. This study clearly demonstrates the positive effects of autologous serum in combination with mesenchymal stem cells and rhBMP-2 on bone formation in a primary stable silica-embedded nano-HA bone grafting material in the sheep model. In further experiments, the results will be transferred to the sheep arteriovenous loop model in order to engineer an axially vascularized primary stable bone replacement in clinically relevant size for free transplantation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>nanostructured bone substitute</kwd><kwd>bone tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>autologous serum</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2</kwd><kwd>sheep model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical size bone defects are still an unsolved problem in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery.

German regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals were observed at all times. The Animal Care Committee of the University of Erlangen-N&#x000fc;rnberg and the government of Mittelfranken, Germany, approved all experiments (Az 54.2531.31-23/06/Az 54-2532.1-44/11). The animals were housed in the veterinary care facility under standardized conditions of 55% air humidity and 18&#x000b0;C room temperature with a 12-hour light/dark rhythm as described previously.<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The sheep were fed once a day with a standard sheep diet (ssniff-Spezialdi&#x000e4;ten GmbH, Soest, Germany) and hay and water ad libitum. The animals were deprived of food for 24 hours prior to surgery to limit regurgitation.</p><p>Sedation and analgesia of the sheep were induced by administration of midazolam (Midazolam-ratiopharm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany) 0.5&#x02013;1 mg/kg intramuscularly and ketamine 5&#x02013;10 mg/kg intramuscularly (Ketavet<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Pharmacia GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Subsequently, orotracheal intubation (7.5 Charri&#x000e8;re) was performed under laryngoscopic control. The respirator (Dr&#x000e4;ger, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany) was adjusted to controlled artificial respiration using intermittent positive pressure ventilation with weight-adapted breath volume. Anesthesia was maintained by inhalation of a gas mixture of 1%&#x02013;2% isoflurane (Forene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Abbott GmbH &#x00026; Co., KG, Wiesbaden, Germany) with air/oxygen. To adjust intraoperative fluid volume loss, the animals received weight-adapted crystalloids (Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) during the operation. Perioperative antibiotic therapy (1&#x02013;1.25 mg/kg cefquinome; Cobactan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Intervet Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei&#x000df;heim, Germany) was administered intramuscularly, followed by a postoperative administration. Carprofen 4 mg/kg was given subcutaneously (Rimadyl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Pfizer, Berlin, Germany) as postoperative analgesia.</p><p>The surgical site was shaved, prepped, and draped for sterility. Subcutaneous pockets were prepared on the back of the sheep. Two nano-HA bone substitute blocks were sutured together with a non-absorbable 3-0 suture, resulting in a diameter of 15&#x000d7;10&#x000d7;10 mm and a volume of 1.5 cm&#x000b3; per construct.

In brief, sealer protein concentrate was dissolved in aprotinin solution (3,000 KIU/mL). Fibrinogen was diluted to a concentration of 20 mg/mL by addition of fibrinogen buffer. Next, 5 mL of 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution was added to thrombin for a final concentration of 500 IU/mL. Blood was collected by puncture of the jugular vein using serum S-Monovette<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> needles (Sarstedt AG &#x00026; Co, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany).

An 11 gauge needle was used to puncture the iliac crest and about 20 mL of bone marrow were aspirated into heparin-coated syringes (6,000 IE/10 mL). The bone marrow was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline 1:4 (Dulbecco 1&#x000d7;; Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) and bone marrow stem cells were harvested by Ficoll gradient centrifugation as described previously.<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>MSC were immediately retransplanted without any interim expansion or storage procedure, or expanded in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum (all from Biochrom AG) to a final cell number of 6 million per implant. Before implantation, the cells were labeled using dioctadecyl-3,3,3&#x02032;3&#x02032;-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; Cell-Tracker&#x02122; CM-DiI, (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Histomorphometric analyses</title><p>For histomorphometric analyses, the cross-sectional areas of the specimens, degraded bone substitute, area with tissue ingrowth, and newly formed bone were measured and calculated as follows. After explantation, constructs were formalin-fixed, decalcified by EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) solution (Fluka; Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St Louis, MO, USA) in an ultrasonic bath (Sonocool<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 255; Bandelin GmbH &#x00026; Co., KG, Berlin, Germany), and paraffin-embedded. Next, 3 &#x003bc;m cross-sections were obtained from two standardized planes using a rotary microtome (Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and photomicrographs were taken using a Leica microscope and digital camera (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).</p><p>For histomorphometric analyses, two sections per specimen were completely scanned at 25&#x000d7; magnification and merged into one image (Adobe Photoshop CS3 extended; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). This image was analyzed semiautomatically in the Leica Application Suite V3 according to the user&#x02019;s manual. One blinded observer detected typical coloring in the hematoxylin-eosin staining for measuring bone surface, cross-sectional and bone substitute degradation area, or in the periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining for calculation of tissue ingrowth area. Images were further processed by generating binary images. These program settings were used for all images. Areas were calculated automatically by the program. Mean values for the results of both planes were used for statistical analyses.</p><p>For calculating absorption of the whole specimen, the cross-sectional area was measured and correlated with the cross-sectional area of a bone substitute block before implantation (bone substitute native). Degraded bone substitute was calculated using the bone substitute and pore surface of a native bone substitute block.</p><p>In the second and third parts of the study, the impact of the different bone formation potential of sheep was reduced by back calculating the percentage of newly formed bone area in the experimental group to the percentage of newly formed bone area in the control group (bone substitute with fibrin).</p><p>For the detection of bone remodeling processes, histochemical tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to identify TRAP-positive, osteoclast-like cells. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the slides were incubated in TRAP buffer (pH 5) containing 3.28 g/L sodium acetate (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and 46.01 g/L sodium tartrate dehydrate (Carl Roth GmbH &#x00026; Co., KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 10 minutes. Immediately afterwards, the sections were placed in freshly prepared TRAP staining solution consisting of 10 mg naphthol AS-MX phosphate and 60 mg Fast Red Violet LB Salt (both Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany), 1,000 &#x003bc;L N-N-dimethylformamide (Merck KGaA), 500 &#x003bc;L Triton X-100 (Carl Roth GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG), and 50 mL TRAP buffer. After an incubation period of about 10&#x02013;60 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, this reaction was stopped by a washing step in distilled water. TRAP-positive cells developed red staining. Finally, the slides were counterstained with Mayer&#x02019;s hemalaun solution (Merck KGaA).</p><p>To determine the extent of osteoclastic activity, four regions of interest were examined at 200&#x000d7; magnification in two planes for each specimen. Regions of interest were chosen at each of the center points of the four outer sides, always ensuring that regions of interest were located in an area of tissue ingrowth. To distinguish TRAP-positive osteoclasts from other cells, such as tissue macrophages and foreign body giant cells, osteoclasts had to meet the following criteria: proximity to bone/bone substitute, more than two nuclei, ruffled border, and granular cytoplasm. For calculation of the osteoclast density per micrometer bone substitute, TRAP-positive cells and length of bone substitute per region of interest were measured (using the interactive measurement of the Leica Application Suite, Leica Microsystems).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical staining</title><p>For identification of endothelial cells, immunohistochemistry with a von Willebrand factor antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-human/mouse/rat; Biocare Medical, Concord, NH, USA) and a secondary biotinylated antibody (anti-rabbit IgG [H+L]; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) was performed by means of the ABC reagent (Vectastain<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Elite ABC Reagent RTU; Vector Laboratories Inc).</p><p>Endothelial cells were also detected by CD31 immunofluorescence staining with a primary monoclonal mouse anti-ovine CD31 antibody (Anti-CD31/PECAM-1; MorphoSys AG, Martinsried/Planegg, Germany) using a biotin-free tyramide signal amplification system (CSA II system; Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark).</p><p>Both endothelial cell stainings were performed, because of the better histological overview in the von Willebrand factor staining and the increased possibility of locating DiI-labeled MSC in relation to the blood endothelial cells in the CD31 staining.

Due to the small group size, a normal distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. The assumption of sphericity was tested by Mauchly&#x02019;s test of sphericity. However, also in the case of non-violation, Greenhouse-Geisser correctional adjustment was applied due to the small group size. In the event of a non-normal distribution, the non-parametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used together with the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test with a Bonferroni-corrected significance level (&#x003b1;&#x02019;=&#x003b1;/m, where &#x003b1; is the level of significance and m is the number of comparisons). For comparing two samples, the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples was used. Homogeneity of variance was checked using Levene&#x02019;s test. Non-normally distributed samples were tested by the non-parametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. The level of statistical significance was set to <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05. A <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264;0.01 was considered to be highly statistically significant. In part 1 of the study, no statistical tests were used due to the small sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Part 1 of the study was carried out for evaluation of the best carrier material (fibrin, cell culture medium, autologous serum) for cells or growth factors to be used in implantation of the nanostructured bone substitute block. In part 2, the scaffold was implanted with different cells (bone marrow, blood, expanded and directly retransplanted MSC) and with the growth factor rhBMP-2. In part 3 of the study, the most promising groups (autologous serum, expanded MSC, rhBMP-2) were combined in two booster groups (expanded MSC and rhBMP-2 in autologous serum and additionally in fibrin; the experimental groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-9-5317">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec><title>Biocompatibility of nanostructured bone substitute material</title><p>In total, 14 separate experimental groups were evaluated in the sheep model. Postoperative seroma at the implantation site developed in a few of the sheep. One of the sheep in the fibrin group developed an infection. Infection did not occur in the blood or bone marrow group (data not shown). This sheep with infected implants was excluded from the study and the groups were repeated in another sheep. None of the other sheep showed any signs of infection or intolerance of the implants.

Cell culture medium and autologous serum were used instead of fibrin and compared with respect to handling, tissue ingrowth, cross-sectional areas of the whole construct, degraded bone substitute area, vascularization, bone formation, and cell behavior. Groups were implanted, comparing all three carrier materials with directly retransplanted and expanded MSC.</p><p>Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining against collagen type I and alkaline phosphatase demonstrated bone formation after 4 weeks only in the experimental groups with expanded MSC in cell culture medium or autologous serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-5317">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>Considerably more bone was seen in constructs with expanded MSC soaked with cell culture medium or autologous serum, compared with fibrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-5317">Figure 2A</xref>).

The explants from the blood and bone marrow group seemed to shrink more, resulting in volumes about half those of the explants from the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5317">Figure 5C and D</xref>). In the measurement of cross-sectional area correlated to a bone substitute block before implantation (bone substitute native), the smallest cross-sectional areas were encountered in explants from the blood and bone marrow group.

The shift from an inorganic to an organic matrix could be demonstrated in all areas where tissue had grown. The surfaces of the bone substitute particles, which were surrounded by newly formed tissue, were purple in color, indicating a high content of polysaccharides, neutral mucopolysaccharides, mucoglycoproteins, and glycoproteins, as well as glycolipids and phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5317">Figure 5E</xref>).

Especially in the border parts of the explants, nano-HA bone substitute particles were surrounded by connective tissue and blood vessels. In the center of some constructs, there was partly no tissue ingrowth on the overview pictures. The explants from the blood, bone marrow, and autologous serum group seemed to have the best tissue ingrowth of 100%. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-5317">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bone formation</title><p>For detection of newly formed bone tissue, slides of all experimental groups were stained against collagen type I, the main component of the organic bone matrix, and alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme synthesized by osteoblasts. Areas positive for collagen type I and alkaline phosphatase could be detected above all in the groups with expanded MSC and rh-BMP-2 in combination with fibrin and serum, as well as in the rhBMP-2 group. Newly formed bone parts could be seen particularly on the surfaces of bone substitute particles. Alkaline phosphatase could be detected near the ossification zone next to osteoblasts synthesizing new bone tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-5317">Figure 6B and C</xref>).</p><p>New bone formation was quantified semiautomatically as mentioned in the Material and methods section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5317">Figure 7A and B</xref>). In the booster groups, combining rhBMP-2 and expanded MSC in carrier medium fibrin or autologous serum, the highest quantities of bone formation could be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5317">Figure 7C</xref>). Subcutaneous bone substitute implants with two different concentrations of rhBMP-2 (12 and 60 &#x003bc;g/mL) have been evaluated in previous experiments, and shown the 60 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration to be superior (data not shown). Comparing the two booster groups, in the group combining rhBMP-2 and expanded MSC in autologous serum, significantly more bone formation could be achieved (<italic>P</italic>=0.025; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5317">Figure 7D</xref>). Expanded MSC and rhBMP-2 alone could enhance bone formation, but, in combination with autologous serum, bone formation was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>=0.016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5317">Figure 7E</xref>). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed upregulation of the bone-specific markers, osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, collagen type I and RUNX2, in nearly all groups when compared with the control (fibrin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-5317">Figure 7F</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Osteoclastic activity</title><p>Slides of all experimental groups were TRAP-stained for quantitative evaluation of osteoclastic activity. Osteoclasts were mainly located at the surface of the bone substitute particles, showing a nearly equal distribution of osteoclastic activity over the constructs. Osteoclasts were counted semiautomatically as mentioned in the Material and methods section. There were no significant differences between the experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-9-5317">Figure 8A and B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Matrix change</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analyses were performed from slides of each experimental group to confirm the element composition in the constructs. For these measurements, two to eight different positions were chosen per section concerning structure and shading. In areas with no or slight tissue ingrowth, relatively high levels of silicon and oxygen could be detected, reflecting the original composition of the bone substitute particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-9-5317">Figure 9A</xref>, position 1). However, in areas with high tissue ingrowth, high carbon and low silicon levels were found, indicating the change from an inorganic to an organic matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-9-5317">Figure 9A</xref>, position 2). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-9-5317">Figure 9B&#x02013;E</xref>, different magnifications of the histological sections are shown. The matrix change could be observed particularly in the border parts of the constructs, in contrast with the centrally located areas with no tissue ingrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Vascularization of constructs</title><p>To examine vascularization, sections from each experimental group were stained against CD31, von Willebrand factor, and &#x003b1;SMA. Newly formed vessels could be detected and were nearly equally distributed all over the constructs in areas with tissue ingrowth. In general, the endothelial cell layer of the vessels could be nicely stained for CD31 and von Willebrand factor, showing different sizes of vessels in the construct. In addition, maturation of larger vessels by coverage of smooth muscle cells was shown by &#x003b1;SMA staining. Remodeling of the vascularization of the constructs in a hierarchically organized system could be demonstrated by the staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-ijn-9-5317">Figure 10A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Behavior of directly retransplanted versus expanded MSC</title><p>Retrieval of cells from histological sections of the explanted constructs was possible because of DiI labeling of the MSC prior to implantation. Both directly retransplanted and expanded MSC could be detected in the explanted constructs. However, cells were distributed all over the areas with tissue ingrowth only in the group with expanded MSC. Directly retransplanted MSC could be identified in noticeably smaller numbers and only in some parts of the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11-ijn-9-5317">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12-ijn-9-5317">12</xref>).</p><p>To confirm proliferation and viability of the transplanted cells, staining with Ki67, a proliferation marker, was performed and apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay. Proliferating cells were identified all over the constructs in areas with tissue ingrowth. Cells double-stained for Ki67 and DiI could be detected in the experimental groups with expanded MSC but not in the groups with directly retransplanted MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11-ijn-9-5317">Figure 11</xref>). In all explants, only single apoptotic cells could be identified by TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12-ijn-9-5317">Figure 12</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, a nano-HA bone substitute was implanted subcutaneously with various additives in a large animal model of the sheep. In the first part of the study, optimal cell carrier materials were evaluated (fibrin, cell culture medium, autologous serum) during an implantation period of 4 weeks. In addition, in the second part of the study, the bone substitute was soaked with different cell types (blood, bone marrow, MSC directly retransplanted and expanded) and the bone growth factor rhBMP-2, and implanted for 12 weeks. Finally, the best additives in parts 1 and 2 of the study were combined in part 3 (implantation period 12 weeks).</p><p>Our results indicate that soaking the nano-HA bone substitute with autologous serum is superior to the clinically approved whole blood and the established cell carrier material, fibrin. Autologous serum in combination with expanded MSC and rhBMP-2 demonstrated the best results with regard to absorption of the scaffold, tissue ingrowth, vascularization, and newly formed bone within the explants.</p><sec><title>Nanostructured bone substitute and its biocompatibility</title><p>The bone substitute is a nanostructured, fully synthetic bone substitute consisting of nanocrystalline HA embedded in a highly porous matrix of silica gel. The bone substitute is not a sintered ceramic, and is produced by what is known as the sol-gel process at a temperature lower than the sintering temperature of HA and silica. The crystallites are loosely packed and held together by SiO<sub>2</sub>, leading to nanopores in the range of 10&#x02013;20 nm.<xref rid="b24-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, micrometer and millimeter pores led to a high porosity of about 60% and to a very large internal surface (84 m<sup>2</sup>/g) favoring the invasion of osteogenic cells and newly formed vessels.</p><p>Nevertheless, the nano-HA bone substitute has a high breaking strength of about 40 MPa. Results of animal experiments, preliminary clinical studies, and histological findings of bone biopsies after implantation suggest this bone substitute to be osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and a promoter of early bone remodeling.<xref rid="b13-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The synthetic nanocrystalline HA is morphologically very similar to biological apatite in bone mineral. A variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that silicon-rich biomaterials are biocompatible and bioactive with osteoconductive characteristics. Previous work suggested that HA with incorporation of silicate ions significantly improved in vivo bioactivity compared with conventional HA materials.<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Another study demonstrated that a bone substitute comprised of nanocrystalline HA embedded in a silica matrix was successful in oral and maxillofacial surgery.<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A previous study showed that the silica gel in the bone substitute is replaced by bone matrix glycoproteins with known functions in attraction, adhesion, and differentiation of bone cells as osteoblasts and osteoclasts.<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Silica has an important impact on regulation of generation, mobilization, differentiation, and activation of osteoclast precursors. It has been established that a high silica content promotes rapid bone mineralization.<xref rid="b26-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These findings indicate that this bone substitute could be an ideal material for the treatment of critical size defects.</p><p>The implants were well tolerated overall by the sheep.

An important aspect of this study was the bone formation capacity of the different groups. Hardly any bone formation was found in explants with directly retransplanted MSC. Therefore, analysis of the first part of the study was reduced to experimental groups with expanded MSC. Cell culture medium and autologous serum proved to be superior to fibrin with regard to bone formation capacity, tissue ingrowth, and degradation of the bone substitute. In constructs with cell culture medium and autologous serum, more TRAP-positive cells could be identified when compared with fibrin. This may be in concordance with reduced vascularization and absorption of the bone substitute in the fibrin group. The expression of osteogenic genes did not demonstrate a significant difference between the experimental groups.</p><p>All these findings can probably be explained by the higher viscosity of fibrin, which is not able to penetrate the block material as good as the more liquid autologous serum or cell culture medium. Irregular soaking of the fibrin sealant may be the reason for the inconsistent bone formation and high standard deviation in the fibrin groups. Positive proliferative and angiogenic effects have been described by other groups, and should have made fibrin an ideal carrier medium for MSC for bone tissue engineering purposes. However, in this study, autologous serum and cell culture medium seemed to be more promising.<xref rid="b28-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> An advantage of autologous serum is that it contains a broad range of growth factors and cytokines. It has been shown that autologous serum has a positive influence on MSC behavior.<xref rid="b30-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For positively charged molecules in particular, it is possible to stick to the negatively charged surface by SiO groups of the bone substitute and therefore promote the remodeling process.<xref rid="b31-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Fibrin could cover the bone substitute surface and therefore mask the SiO groups, so that the matrix change and induction of bone formation could not take place. In addition, use of autologous serum is not associated with as many regulatory issues as using serum or fibrin of foreign species.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Due to the range of positive aspects of autologous serum and the similar results with cell culture medium, we finally decided to use autologous serum in the following part of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Degradation, absorption, and matrix change of bone substitute</title><p>As cell sources, blood, bone marrow, directly retransplanted and expanded MSC were implanted in combination with the bone substitute.

In some areas without any tissue ingrowth, relatively high amounts of inorganic matrix could be detected, representing the original bone substitute matrix.

In our study constructs soaked with whole blood, high interindividual variance concerning bone formation was obvious. In addition, bone formation remained very low compared with previous bone substitute studies. However, it has to be kept in mind that the present experiment involves induction of ectopic (that means in abnormal sites) bone formation in subcutis. Dietze et al emphasize that contact between the nano-HA bone substitute and well vascularized bone is essential for successful therapy.<xref rid="b37-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> For this reason, ectopic bone formation, needed for our tissue engineering purposes, is not possible using the bone substitute solely soaked with whole blood.</p><p>Differing interindividual results were observed in the group with bone marrow. Some sheep had high yields of bone formation, whereas some showed only early bone formation. This could be due to the heterogeneous cell population and often low numbers of MSC located in the bone marrow.<xref rid="b38-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In addition, growth factor and cytokine concentrations are known to be very variable.<xref rid="b39-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The expected benefit of endothelial progenitor cells and angiogenic growth factors, as described by other groups,<xref rid="b41-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b46-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> could not be observed.<xref rid="b47-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>One strategy to improve these results is to concentrate the bone marrow cell fraction, which in the present study involved directly retransplanted MSC.

However, after 4 weeks, expanded MSC clearly showed an earlier and faster potential for new bone formation. Moreover, in constructs with directly retransplanted MSC, less labeled MSC could be found than in constructs with expanded MSC. This could possibly be due to the higher cell numbers achieved after expansion and the variable and low numbers of stem cells in the concentrated directly retransplanted MSC, which could not be determined before implantation.</p><p>RhBMP-2 was used as a bone growth factor, inducing a high rate of bone formation in the constructs alone and in combination with expanded MSC.

In our study, osteoclastic activity was comparable in all constructs from the 12-week group, and bone formation in the tissue around the implants could not be observed.</p><p>BMP-2 should be used in a carrier medium that ensures its slow release over time. Fibrin was used for that purpose in several previous studies, and seems to be ideal for slow growth factor release. In addition, it is absorbable and supports angiogenic ingrowth.<xref rid="b55-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="b56-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> In this study, soaking the scaffolds with fibrin resulted in inferior results when compared with autologous serum and cell culture medium, possibly due to the special nanostructured architecture. Comparison of the two combination groups with expanded MSC and rhBMP-2 in fibrin and serum demonstrated that fibrin is not crucial for the delivery of the growth factor BMP-2 over time. We could clearly show that addition of BMP-2 to serum markedly increases the capacity for bone formation while always using the same batch of serum, so at least intratest validity and reproducibility were ensured in this study.</p><p>HA is a calcium phosphate (Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH), which represents 55% of the weight of bone in vertebrates. Silicon, an essential trace element, plays an active role in human bone mineralization and calcification, and was demonstrated to be pivotal in formation of connective tissue and stimulation of osteoblast proliferation.<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The bone substitute used in this study has been made of both HA and silica, which is achieved through specific sol-gel techniques. After heterotopic transplantation of this bone substitute, there is a change of the inorganic silica gel matrix into organic host compounds.<xref rid="b25-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> By soaking the bone substitute with growth factors, the protein is incorporated into the scaffold prior to the matrix change. The kinetics of the initial matrix change of the implanted biomaterial are enhanced by this procedure. The protein is released into the extracellular environment during the following matrix change and degradation of the bone substitute, supporting bone growth.</p><p>Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed upregulation of osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, collagen type I, and RUNX2 in nearly all groups when compared with the control (bone substitute with fibrin). No statistically significant differences between the experimental groups could be determined. However, high standard deviations were observed. The upregulation of osteogenic markers in all the bone substitute groups indicates good osteogenic and osteoinductive properties of the nano-HA bone substitute, as described previously.<xref rid="b13-ijn-9-5317" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It should be noted that the areas in which bone formation and remodeling of the bone substitute take place were not equally distributed over the constructs. Only a small part of the explants was analyzed for molecular biology, probably leading to use of non-representative samples from the experimental groups and resulting in high standard deviations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A nanostructured clinically approved bone substitute material was evaluated in this study, soaked with different carrier materials, and implanted in a large animal model in combination with different cells and the bone growth factor rhBMP-2. Autologous serum improves tissue ingrowth of the nano-HA bone substitute and leads to earlier and more rapid bone formation compared with fibrin. Because of its low viscosity, autologous serum is ideal for penetration of the nanostructured bone substitute and can induce early matrix change by delivery of a wide range of autologous growth factors and cytokines. Osteogenic cells and rhBMP-2 could therefore evenly distribute into the bone substitute, with degradation and simultaneous bone formation within the nano-HA bone substitute being stimulated.</p><p>Combining expanded MSC with rhBMP-2 in autologous serum leads to a high yield of bone formation and is superior to the clinically approved procedure where the bone substitute is soaking in whole blood. In the next step, these results should be transferred to the sheep arteriovenous loop model to engineer axially vascularized primary stable bone replacement of a clinically relevant size.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Stefan Fleischer, Marina Milde, and Ilse Arnold-Herberth for their excellent technical support.

(<bold>F</bold>) Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed upregulation of bone-specific genes, ie, osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, collagen type I and RUNX2, in nearly all groups compared with the control (fibrin).
