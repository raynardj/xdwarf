A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the cutting surfaces of each blade. High-magnification imaging was used to measure the geometry of straight and oblique incisions made through circular silicone discs. Leakage testing was conducted on the sclerotomy sites after simulated vitrectomy in enucleated porcine eyes. Video recordings captured the creation of the sclerotomy incisions from inside the eye.</p><sec><title>SEM analyses of blade cutting surface</title><p>After removal of the plastic handle, each trocar blade (n=1 per design) was mounted on conductive carbon tape. The cutting edge was examined using an AMRAY 1610 SEM (AMRAY, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of incision shapes</title><p>For each blade type, ten straight and ten oblique incisions were assessed, with a new blade used for each incision to avoid confounding effects of blade dulling. An incision was created with each type of blade through a silicone disc that was secured to a metal plate below a mount holding each type of blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-8-2307">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The Instron Single Test Column System (Model 5542; Instron, Norwood, MA, USA) was lowered until the blades completely penetrated the silicone disc. Using a novel method of assessing simulated incision geometry, straight (90&#x000b0; angle) and oblique (30&#x000b0; angle) incisions were created by rotating the mounted silicone disc 90&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0; relative to the blade, respectively. A bevel-down direction was used for the pointed beveled and round-tipped beveled blades. Two illuminated optic fibers were placed on opposite sides of the silicone disc to transilluminate the incision site during blade penetration.</p><p>The width and thickness of incisions at the entry and exit sites were assessed using a digital measuring instrument and associated software (Optical Gauging Products, Rochester, NY, USA). Incision endpoints were marked with crosshairs using the Optical Gauging Products software, which then calculated the distance between endpoints (ie, incision width) and the length of incision deviation from a virtual straight line connecting the endpoints (ie, incision thickness; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-8-2307">Figure 2A</xref>). Incision width and thickness were related to the width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-8-2307">Figure 2B</xref>) and the thickness of the blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-8-2307">Figure 2C</xref>), respectively. The incision entry site corresponded to the conjunctival side of the eye, and the exit site corresponded to the side of the vitreous. Incision thickness (ie, deviation from an ideal straight line between endpoints of the incision width) was calculated using the maximum deviation distance from ideal straightness.</p></sec><sec><title>Wound leakage</title><p>Twenty-eight fresh porcine eyes obtained from a local abattoir were used for the wound leakage experiments (n=4 per blade design and gauge). For each test, eyes were mounted in the same orientation and, to realistically model surgical technique, incisions were created manually by a single investigator (MI). The conjunctiva was displaced during incision creation. Each trocar cannula system was inserted obliquely through the pars plana in the same location for each eye; a bevel-down direction was used for the pointed beveled and round-tipped beveled blades. A protractor was used to ensure that incision angles were similar among eyes. Three incisions were created 3.0 mm posterior to the limbus for the infusion cannula, endoilluminator, and vitrectomy probe. The incision that was used for the vitrectomy probe was evaluated for leakage in each eye after plugs were applied to cannulas in the other incisions. Wound leakage was defined as a continuous leakage of fluid from the incision site. A complete core vitrectomy was performed with the core duty-cycle mode using the CONSTELLATION<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Vision System (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) at 5,000 cuts/minute and 650-mmHg vacuum pressure. Every effort was made to remove the vitreous in the periphery and around the cannula until free flow of irrigation solution out of the cannula was observed. To make potential leakage more visible, approximately 0.2 mL of 2.5-mg/mL indocyanine green solution was injected into the infusion line.</p><p>The nonvalved cannula used with the vitrectomy probe was removed from the sclera using the guidance of the vitrectomy probe shaft. After the cannulas were removed, the incision was massaged with a cotton swab for at least 10 seconds at 30-mmHg infusion to seal the incision. After the incision was sealed, the conjunctiva was trimmed to enable visualization of any fluid leakage from the incision site. Using Castroviejo forceps, the conjunctiva near the targeted incision site was trimmed to create a 5- to 7-mm diameter hole. Assessment of wound closure by measuring leakage under increasing infusion pressure has been described previously.<xref rid="b23-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Using a novel approach in which infusion pressure was controlled by the vitrectomy machine, the infusion pressure was lowered to 0 mmHg and increased in 5-mmHg increments until leakage was observed. The infusion pressure at which wound leakage occurred was documented, and wound leakage was scored on a scale from one to six as follows: low infusion pressure (1: 0&#x02013;23 mmHg), moderate infusion pressure (2: 24&#x02013;47 mmHg or 3: 48&#x02013;71 mmHg), moderate&#x02013;high infusion pressure (4: 72&#x02013;95 mmHg or 5: 96&#x02013;119 mmHg), and high infusion pressure (6: &#x02265;120 mmHg). A higher leakage score indicated less leakage (ie, better incision sealing).</p></sec><sec><title>Endoscopic evaluation of inner sclerotomy sites</title><p>Fourteen fresh porcine eyes obtained from a local abattoir were used for the inner sclerotomy-site experiments. An endoscopic attachment (VH-B18; KEYENCE Corporation, Osaka, Japan) was mounted to a digital microscope (VHX-1000; KEYENCE Corporation). The endoscope, with a rod lens 1.9 mm in diameter, was inserted through a posterior sclerotomy site and positioned such that the pars plana was visible. Three oblique incisions were created 3.0 mm posterior to the limbus, and the penetration of each blade was observed from inside the eye with the endoscope. As described above, porcine eyes were mounted in the same orientation, and incisions were manually created by a single investigator; incision angles were standardized using a protractor. The insertion and removal of the trocar cannula system were photographed through the endoscope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) with Excel Statistics 2010 Add-On (Social Survey Research Information, Tokyo, Japan). The nonparametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences between data sets for incision thickness and width. If a statistical difference existed between at least two of the samples, the Scheff&#x000e9; test was applied to identify where the differences were for multiple comparisons. Wound leakage scores were compared between blade types using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Both MVR blades generated a groove at the incision vertex. The shape of the incisions created by 23- and 25-gauge pointed and round-tipped beveled blades was round at the entry site and an acute-angle &#x0201c;V&#x0201d; shape at the exit site. The path of the round-tipped beveled incisions from the entry site to the exit site appeared longer than the incisions created by the other blades.</p><p>For both straight and oblique incisions, incision thickness was related to the straightness (ie, linearity of entry and exit sites) of the incision, with thinner incisions corresponding to smaller deviation from straightness.

All oblique incisions appeared to seal in the same manner.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings from this study show that each blade type had a unique design and created a distinct incision shape. All of the blades tested had a right-to-left symmetry; only the ridged MVR blades had a unilateral front-to-back symmetry and created linear, slit-like incisions.</p><p>The ridged MVR blades created the thinnest incisions using straight entry. In the case of oblique incisions, the round-tipped beveled blades created the thinnest incisions at the entry sites but produced a thicker incision at the exit sites. The 23-gauge round-tipped beveled and pointed beveled blades created thicker incisions at the exit sites than at the entry sites, indicating more three-dimensional longitudinal wound architecture compared with both MVR-type blades. A quadrilateral facet was observed near the tip of the non-ridged MVR blade, suggesting that additional tip sharpening may have occurred during manufacturing. A sharper tip would facilitate incision creation, but the facet could cause the tissue to be cut unevenly, resulting in the nonlinear &#x0201c;M&#x0201d;-shaped incision observed in our incision architecture assessment. Surface striations were observed on non-ridged MVR, pointed beveled, and round-tipped beveled blades; these striations are likely artifacts introduced during manufacture and sharpening. Burrs were also evident on the cutting edge of the pointed bev-eled blade and could lead to creation of thicker incisions.</p><p>Oblique incisions made with non-ridged MVR blades in wound leakage testing were thicker at the entry site and had a lower leakage score (indicating more leakage at lower pressure) compared with oblique incisions made with ridged MVR blades. Wound leakage at low or moderate infusion pressures was observed with the non-ridged MVR blades, the pointed beveled blades, and the round-tipped beveled blades, suggesting unstable wound closure. Both the ridged and non-ridged MVR blades created thinner incisions at entry and exit sites. To achieve better wound closure, linear wound structure at the inner (exit) site is believed to be important for avoiding leakage of intraocular fluid and postoperative hypotony.<xref rid="b25-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The lack of wound leakage observed with ridged MVR blade incisions suggests that the linear slit-like incision made with these blades had more stable closure than the other incision shapes. This finding is consistent with previous reports that &#x0201c;V&#x0201d;-shaped or chevron-shaped incisions are associated with greater wound leakage and postoperative wound gaping.<xref rid="b22-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b26-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>In a study of human eyes undergoing vitrectomy surgery, incisions created with MVR blades were linear-shaped and led to less postoperative wound gaping than chevron-shaped incisions created with a conventional blade.<xref rid="b26-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Several clinical studies have shown that MVR-style blades improve wound closure compared with beveled trocar cannulas.<xref rid="b25-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> For example, the two-step sclerotomy method of initial penetration with an MVR blade followed by a blunt-tipped cannula inserter has been shown to reduce early postoperative hypotony<xref rid="b27-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and wound leakage<xref rid="b25-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> compared with the beveled trocar cannula.

Together, these studies suggest that the morphologic differences among incisions created with trocar blades of different designs may influence wound closure.</p><p>Previous endoscopic evaluations showed that vitreous blocked the inner lips of the sclerotomy ports after conventional 23- and 25-gauge vitrectomy in uncomplicated cases of vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetic retinopathy.<xref rid="b30-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our endoscopic observations had similar findings of vitreous incarceration at the inner sclerotomy sites. The incarcerated vitreous may act as a plug and help to seal the wound, preventing fluid leakage. In a recent study of wound closure after 25-gauge vitrectomy, swept-source OCT did not find significantly better rates of self-sealing and faster recovery of sclerotomies made with 25-gauge MVR blades compared with beveled blades.<xref rid="b31-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Thus, the MVR-type blades may have created a better wound structure, but it is possible that variations in incarcerated vitreous at the inner sclerotomy sites caused an unevenness in the self-sealing of sclerotomies that is independent of the wound structure. In the current study, we observed vitreous incarceration and similar wound closing with all blades tested and a lack of wound leakage with ridged MVR blades only; observed wound leakage with the non-ridged MVR, pointed beveled, and round-tipped beveled blades may therefore be related to effects of blade architecture on incarcerated vitreous and evenness of wound closure.</p><p>Together, the SEM image analysis, straight and oblique incision measurements, and wound leakage results suggest that the unilateral front-to-back and bilateral symmetry of the ridged MVR blades resulted in the linear, slit-like incisions observed for both straight and oblique angles. The combination of thinner thickness and smaller width of oblique incisions contributed to the incision architecture, which was associated with minimized wound leakage in the presence of increasing infusion pressure in porcine eyes. These findings are consistent with the results of a previous study showing that smaller-diameter oblique sclerotomies offered significantly more mechanical resistance to fluid flow at higher intraocular pressure in vitrectomized porcine eyes.<xref rid="b32-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Reduced wound leakage, similar to that observed with MVR blades in the current study and in the reports described above, may reduce the incidence of postoperative hypotony and endophthalmitis in a clinical setting.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that a silicone disc and porcine eyes were used to model human tissue; the results described here may not translate directly to clinical outcomes because of differences between human eyes and our model systems. The wound leakage and endoscopy experiments were performed in a relatively small number of porcine eyes using oblique incisions only; therefore, further evaluations may be needed. Furthermore, the lowest and highest infusion pressures used to evaluate wound leakage (5 mmHg and &#x02265;120 mmHg, respectively) may not be observed in routine MIVS; however, the pressures used in this study enabled assessment of incision sealing across a clinically relevant range of potential intraoperative pressures. Additionally, factors other than incision geometry (eg, lack of conjunctival displacement, patient-induced wound distortion) that may influence wound leakage<xref rid="b3-opth-8-2307" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> were not addressed in the current study. These issues and the unmasked nature of this study may limit the strength of conclusions that can be inferred from our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the shape of the incisions and SEM analysis showed distinct differences in the architecture of the incisions, depending on the blade design and incision geometry. No leakage was observed with the incisions made using ridged MVR blades. The linear slit-like incisions generated with the ridged and non-ridged MVR-style blades were generally smaller at entry and exit sites and had more linear wound apposition compared with those generated by the beveled blades. Endoscopic assessment showed vitreous incarceration with all trocar cannula systems. These laboratory results highlight the differences among existing entry systems and suggest that ridged MVR blades may maximize the benefits of vitrectomy by minimizing wound leakage.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank David C Buboltz, MBA, for his assistance in organizing this study.
