However, in human HPS, restrictive ventilatory defects are also observed supporting that the alveolar epithelial compartment may also be affected. Alveolar type II epithelial cells (AT2) play a critical role in maintaining the alveolar compartment by producing four surfactant proteins (SPs, SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D) which also facilitate alveolar repair following injury. However, no studies have evaluated the alveolar epithelial compartment in experimental HPS. In this study, we evaluated the alveolar epithelial compartment and particularly AT2 cells in experimental HPS induced by common bile duct ligation (CBDL). We found a significant reduction in pulmonary SP production associated with increased apoptosis in AT2 cells after CBDL relative to controls. Lung morphology showed decreased mean alveolar chord length and lung volumes in CBDL animals that were not seen in control models supporting a selective reduction of alveolar airspace. Furthermore, we found that administration of TNF-&#x003b1;, the bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and FXR nuclear receptor activation (GW4064) induced apoptosis and impaired SP-B and SP-C production in alveolar epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results imply that AT2 cell dysfunction occurs in experimental HPS and is associated with alterations in the alveolar epithelial compartment. Our findings support a novel contributing mechanism in experimental HPS that may be relevant to humans and a potential therapeutic target.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant 5DKR01DK056804 (Michael B.

Over the past decade, studies in human and CBDL HPS have focused on dilation and angiogenesis in the pulmonary microvascular compartment which result in altered blood flow and impaired gas diffusion capacity across the alveolar-capillary membrane <xref rid="pone.0113451-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Abrams2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, whether the respiratory epithelial compartment is affected in chronic liver disease has not been well defined. In the present study, we evaluated the functional properties of alveolar epithelial cells and lung morphology after CBDL up to 3 wk to define if the epithelial compartment is affected. We have found a selective decrease in pulmonary surfactant protein levels accompanied by AT2 cell apoptosis and a reduction in alveolar airspace, which occurs as HPS develops after CBDL. These alterations are not seen in PVL animals where HPS does not develop. Moreover, bile acids and TNF-&#x003b1; treatment increased cell apoptosis and decreased surfactant protein expression in cultured AT2 cells. Accordingly, we found a selective increase in restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with HPS relative to non-HPS cirrhotics consistent with loss of alveolar airspace. These findings support that alterations in alveolar structure and function may occur in both experimental and human HPS.</p><p>Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that lines the alveolar surface. The protein portion contains four surfactant associated proteins and plays a crucial role in the maintenance of surfactant stability, alveolar integrity and respiratory function as well as in the regulation of lung inflammation and injury <xref rid="pone.0113451-Fehrenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Frerking1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In the present study, we found a reduction in all lung surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D) after CBDL which has not been previously identified. This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in total lung size by water displacement and in alveolar size indicated by a reduction in alveolar mean chord length. These morphologic alterations support that altered surfactant protein production may disrupt alveolar integrity and lead to alveolar collapse. Our findings are consistent with and may explain results from a recent study focusing on lung respiratory mechanics in CBDL animals, which found a reduction in tidal volume, minute ventilation and mean inspiratory flow rate attributable to uneven distribution of alveolar ventilation <xref rid="pone.0113451-MeloSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. These results are unique relative to other primary lung diseases associated with a reduction in surfactant in that lung injury is not a significant feature in HPS. Additional alterations including diaphragmatic and respiratory muscle wasting particularly after prolonged CBDL could also contribute to changes in respiratory mechanics <xref rid="pone.0113451-GayanRamirez1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, our finding that restrictive PFT changes are also found in HPS cirrhotics but not in non-HPS cirrhotics suggest that alveolar alterations may be unique to HPS.</p><p>The mechanisms for the reduced surfactant protein production after CBDL are not fully defined. AT2 cells are the only lung cells that produce all four surfactant proteins and SP-C biosynthesis occurs exclusively in AT2 cells. In the present study, we hypothesized that two potential pathways might lead to decreased SP production in lung; alveolar type 2 epithelial cell apoptosis and decreased surfactant protein expression. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings showing increased numbers of TUNEL positive AT2 cells and increased cleaved caspase-3 levels in lung and isolated AT2 cells from CBDL confirm AT2 cell apoptosis. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings that bile acids (CDCA), a specific bile acid nuclear receptor FXR&#x003b1; agonist and TNF-&#x003b1;, each induced both cell apoptosis and decreased surfactant protein expression in cultured AT2 cells define potential pathways that drive apoptosis and support that effects on surfactant protein expression may also occur. Elevated bile acid and TNF-&#x003b1; levels in plasma are found in human cirrhosis and in animal models including CBDL and are recognized to induce cell apoptosis through the activation of extrinsic or intrinsic pathways in a number of cell types <xref rid="pone.0113451-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Zhang4" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Nunes1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Relative to CBDL, PVL lung does not develop alveolar epithelial alterations and TNF-&#x003b1; levels are not increased in this situation and levels of serum bile acids although higher than normal are reported to be significantly lower than 3-week CBDL. Whether the magnitude of bile acid level increase or a synergetic effect of bile acids and TNF-&#x003b1; after CBDL contribute to the selective alterations in AT2 cells after CBDL are not defined. In addition, increased mononuclear cell infiltration in the lung is associated with decreased surfactant protein production in some inflammatory pulmonary diseases <xref rid="pone.0113451-King1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In experimental HPS, monocytes are recruited to the pulmonary intravascular space via altered chemokine/receptor expression (such as fractalkine/CX3CL1) <xref rid="pone.0113451-Zhang5" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Whether these cells also produce inflammatory cytokines or mediators that influence AT2 cells needs further investigation.</p><p>In normal lung, effective pulmonary arterial gas exchange is achieved by a proper alveolar ventilation (V<sub>A</sub>)/perfusion (Q) ratio. In previous studies, we and other have clearly defined that intrapulmonary vasodilatation causes abnormalities in capillary blood flow that lead to V/Q mismatch and drives impaired oxygenation in human and experimental HPS <xref rid="pone.0113451-Fallon2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Nunes1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Thenappan1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Our observations in the present study extend these findings and support that a ventilation defect due to loss of alveolar type II cell surfactant may be also present in experimental HPS and may augment V/Q mismatch. Although chronic liver disease has been associated with restrictive ventilatory defects in certain situations <xref rid="pone.0113451-Scarlata1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Hourani1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113451-Lima1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the unique combination of perfusion impairments and ventilatory defects in experimental HPS may explain the potential for significant gas exchange abnormalities in the absence of marked histologic abnormalities.
