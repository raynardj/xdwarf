adopted the habit of sitting with their legs crossed. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects
were 232 adults in their 20s and 30s (84 males and 148 females). They were divided into
0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-hour or more groups by observing how much time per day they sat with
their legs crossed while sitting on a chair. We measured the postural alignment of all the
subjects in the sagittal plane and coronal plane. In the sagittal plane, distances from
the line of gravity to the external auditory meatus, the shoulder joints, the knee joints,
and the calcaneocuboid joint were measured. In the coronal plane, the shoulder inclination
and the pelvic tilt were measured. [Results] The shoulder joints, the knee joints, and the
calcaneocuboid joint did not show any significant differences, but the head was aligned
further forward in the 3-hour group compared to the other groups. In the coronal plane,
the acromion processes and the anterior superior iliac spines of the 3-hour group showed
statistically significant differences than those of all of the other groups. [Conclusion]
The results indicate that sitting with the legs crossed for longer than three hours per
day may cause shoulder inclination, lateral pelvic tilt and forward head posture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cross legged position</kwd><kwd>Posture</kwd><kwd>Sitting time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Posture refers to the collective position of all the joints at a given moment. The term
posture is also used to refer to the alignment of the body. When static postural alignment
is maintained, the various joints can be described by body segments. In the standard
position, the spine forms a normal curve and the skeleton of the lower half of the body is
in a state of ideal alignment that is able to bear the weight of the body<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In psychology, there are several concepts
that define an individual&#x02019;s permanent characteristics. Similarly, in physiology, certain
habitual positions may reflect an individual&#x02019;s stable characteristics<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proper alignment of the body segments not only maintains the correct postures of the upper
and lower body but also prevents pain that may result from bad posture<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, when bad posture becomes a long-term habit, poor
postural alignment results in various musculoskeletal and nervous system diseases. Snijders
et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> state that the internal and
external oblique abdominal muscle are less active in sitting postures than in standing
postures, and that the external oblique abdominal muscle are less active in sitting with the
legs crossed. Variations in muscle activity in sitting with the legs crossed can be
identified.</p><p>Currently, people spend more time sitting than standing due to the development of science
and technology and automation. Dependence on automobiles, even for traveling short
distances, and long periods spent working on computers, contribute to today&#x02019;s sedentary
lifestyles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the daily time spent in
sitting postures increases, it is common to find people sitting with their legs crossed. The
blood pressure of those with orthostatic hypotension rises when they sit with the legs
crossed<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the reasons why
people sit with the legs crossed have not been clearly identified, several studies have
proposed that it is because it gives stability to the lower extremities when sitting
postures are maintained for an extended time, or for aesthetic reasons, for example, when a
person is wearing a short skirt<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
a sitting with the legs crossed involves too many risk factors to be adopted for convenience
or beauty. Studies have reported that sitting with the legs crossed may alter the
weight-bearing or loads on soft tissues and muscles, resulting in unstable postures<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and elicit negative effects, such as slower
blood flow, varicose veins, and modified posture<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. If an individual habitually adopts such postures, part of the body
will deviate from proper alignment, and deformation will be aggravated, to compensate for
the unstable state<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, causing problems in
the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify postural
changes in adults who have adopted the habit of sitting with legs crossed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 232 adults in their 20s and 30s (84 males and 148 females) who, through
previous examination, were divided into two groups: those who habitually crossed their
legs when sitting and those who did not. Those who crossed their legs were further divided
into a one-hour group, a two-hour group, and a three-hour or more group by observing how
much time per day they sat with their legs crossed while sitting on a chair. The subjects
were selected from among those who had no disorders in their musculoskeletal or
nervous/muscular systems, had not sustained any injuries or undergone surgery during the
last six months, and had no posture-related problems.</p><p>The subjects were selected from among those who understood the purpose of this study and
were capable of understanding and complying with the tester&#x02019;s instructions. All subjects
understood the purpose of this study, agreed to participate in this research, and signed
an informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To compare changes in postures relative to the length of time spent sitting with the legs
crossed, subjects were surveyed by questionnaire about the habit of crossing their legs,
and the length of time spent with their legs crossed, than they were measured. Photos were
taken in the sagittal and coronal planes using a digital camera, and the subjects&#x02019;
postures were measured using a global posture system (GPS, Chinesport, Udine, Italy).
Thereafter, the subjects were divided into four groups: those without the habit of
crossing their legs, and groups of those with the habit of crossing their legs for one
hour per day, two hours per day, or at least three hours per day. The postures of the
subjects in these groups were comparatively analyzed. For this study, a cross-legged
posture was defined as placing one leg over the thigh of the other leg.</p><p>To measure the subjects&#x02019; postural alignment, the subjects were instructed to take off
their top, wear shorts, and stand in a natural posture with their feet placed in the
footmarks on the GPS examination stand. Thereafter, the subjects&#x02019; images were taken in the
sagittal and coronal planes using a digital camera. The images were subsequently analyzed
using proprietary software. In the sagittal plane, distances from the line of gravity to
the external auditory meatus, the shoulder joints, the knee joints, and the calcaneocuboid
joint were measured. The unit used was (mm). In the coronal plane, the shoulder
inclination and the pelvic tilt were measured. The shoulder gradient was calculated as the
difference between the heights of the acromion processes on the two sides, and the pelvic
tilt was measured using the difference between the heights of the anterior superior iliac
spines (ASIS) on the two sides. The unit used was (mm). Larger values indicate greater
incline of the shoulders and pelvis.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14 for Windows (SPSS Institute
Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea). All results are presented as mean&#x000b1;SD. In order to
analyze the postural changes in the sagittal and coronal planes according to cross-legged
sitting time. One-way ANOVA was used to compare differences among the values for each
group, and multiple analyses of three groups were performed using Turkey&#x02019;s test.
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of the 232 participants in this study are shown <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No leg-crossing<break/>(n=64)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (n=56)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (n=60)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (n=52)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total (n=232)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.6&#x000b1;2.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.7&#x000b1;2.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.2&#x000b1;3.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1&#x000b1;1.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.2&#x000b1;2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.7&#x000b1;7.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.4&#x000b1;9.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.4&#x000b1;10.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.7&#x000b1;9.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.4&#x000b1;8.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.0&#x000b1;12.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.8&#x000b1;14.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.6&#x000b1;11.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.3&#x000b1;9.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.6&#x000b1;12.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>1, 1-hour group; 2, 2-hour group; 3, 3-hour group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

experience changes in posture relative to the length of time that they sit with their legs
crossed. The results show that subjects with the habit of sitting with their legs crossed
for at least three hours per day had statistically significant differences in the heights of
the acromion processes and the ASISs between the two sides. Subjects preferred to cross the
right leg over the left, but this had no effect on the postural change.</p><p>Currently, people spend more time in sitting than in standing postures due to developments
in science, technology and automation. Dependence on automobiles, even for traveling short
distances, and extended periods spent on working computers contribute to today&#x02019;s sedentary
lifestyles. Stationary, cross-legged sitting postures are assumed quite frequently and are
perceived as comfortable by all age groups, and by both males and females<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. If an individual works for an extended
period of time in a sitting position, maintanining a proper posture may become
difficult<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle fatigue
increases. Previous studies have indicated that people prefer sitting with the legs crossed
because it change the weight or load on soft tissues and muscles; and provides stability to
the lower extremities or because of social situations or for aesthetic reasons<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cross-legged postures are useful when
sitting positions are maintained for a long time because crossing the legs reduces trunk
muscle fatigue<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, crossing the legs may cause rotation of the pelvis<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, thereby causing problems in the lumbar region. Studies report that
lateral pelvic tilt might result when the hip abductors are weakened<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. When sitting with the legs crossed, one leg is placed
over the supporting leg, and the leg placed on top is in a state of abduction. Therefore,
the gluteus medius, which is related to abduction, is stretched for an extended period and
thereby weakened, resulting in lateral tilt of the pelvis. In the present study, a
statistically significant lateral pelvic tilt was identified in the group that sat with
their legs crossed for at least three hours per day, indicating that sitting with the legs
crossed for three hours or longer may result in lateral pelvic tilt related to weakening of
the gluteus medius.</p><p>Previous studies have also suggested that when the legs are crossed, an insufficient range
of hip flexion is compensated by lumbar bending, which might increase the rotational moment
of the lumbar spine<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the pelvis is
tilted laterally, the lumbar spine may be bent due to lateral instability and impaired
movements<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lateral spinal flexion is
called scoliosis. Scoliosis caused by habitual postures is called postural scoliosis, and
may cause pain and problems in muscles and joints due to abnormal force distribution<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, although scoliosis was not
measured, the group sitting with their legs crossed for at least3 hours a day showed lateral
tilt of the pelvis and the acromion processes showed significant differences, indicating the
possibility of lateral flexion of the spine. Therefore, sitting cross-legged for an extended
period can be considered a factor that may cause not only lateral pelvic tilt but also
changes in spinal posture.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that a 6.3-mm or greater difference between the ASISs of the
two sides might result in pelvic lateral tilt<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, a 9-mm or greater difference might cause pain and changes in
joints<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a 15&#x02005;mm or greater
difference might lead to pelvic torsion<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the three-hour group showed a mean difference
of 13.25-mm between the ASIS of the two sides, indicating that pelvic pain and changes in
the joints might occur. When sitting with the legs crossed, weight bearing on the supporting
leg tends to increase, further leading to unstable postures<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such excessive weight bearing would bring about gradual changes in
the musculoskeletal system due to static postures, thereby causing secondary problems.</p><p>Lumbar flexion is greater when sitting with the legs crossed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A flexed trunk may affect the maintenance of proper support of the
trunk and the position of the head in a sitting posture<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, although subjects in the three-hour group
did not show significantly larger distance from the external auditory meatus, their heads
were aligned further forward than in the other groups. Therefore, sitting with their legs
crossed for longer than three hours influenced their trunk posture, and the position of
their heads.</p><p>As reviewed above, sitting cross-legged for longer than three hours per day may cause
shoulder and pelvic lateral tilts, and aligned the head further forward. These are factors
that can cause pain and changes in joints, or result in spinal lateral flexion and forward
head posture. This study measured postural changes relative to time spent sitting with the
legs crossed, and we consider, further studies that include spinal postures and the kinetics
