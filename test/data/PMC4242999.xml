Here we prospectively assessed the short- and long-term efficacy of an inpatient multidisciplinary programme for patients with FNS. We also sought to determine predictors of good outcome by assessing the responsiveness of different scales administered at admission, discharge and follow-up. Sixty-six consecutive patients were included. Assessments at admission, discharge and at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up (55&#x000a0;%) included: the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Common Neurological Symptom Questionnaire, the Fear Questionnaire and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. At discharge and at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up patients were also asked to complete five-point self-rated scales of improvement. There were significant improvements in clinician-rated mental health and functional ability. In addition, patients reported that their levels of mood and anxiety had improved and that they were less bothered by somatic symptoms in general and neurological symptoms in particular. Two-thirds of patients rated their general health such as &#x0201c;better&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; at discharge and this improvement was maintained over the following year. Change in HoNOS score was the only measure that successfully predicted patient-rated improvement. Our data suggest that a specialized multidisciplinary inpatient programme for FNS can provide long-lasting benefits in the majority of patients. Good outcome at discharge was exclusively predicted by improvement in the HoNOS which continued to improve over the 1&#x000a0;year following discharge.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Functional neurological symptoms</kwd><kwd>Psychogenic neurological symptoms</kwd><kwd>Conversion disorders</kwd><kwd>Inpatient programme</kwd><kwd>Psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functional neurological symptoms (FNS) represent one of the commonest diagnoses made in outpatient neurology clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Long-term follow-up studies report lack of recovery and even worsening of symptoms in one half to two-thirds of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>To date there are no official guidelines for the treatment of FNS. Different approaches, including pharmacotherapy (mainly antidepressants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], psychological therapies (both cognitive-behavioural and psychodynamic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], hypnotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and physical rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], have been considered helpful in a variable proportion of patients with FNS. Inpatient treatment programmes combining different approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have also been described. We have recently shown that patients with functional symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] benefitted from this approach; but the sample was small, and only included patients with functional motor symptoms. In addition, this a retrospective study, based on patients&#x02019; own estimation of their disability up to 7&#x000a0;years earlier. In another study, also restricted to functional motor symptoms, McCormack et al. found significant improvement following a multidisciplinary inpatient programme. This was again retrospective and relied on case notes rather than direct patient contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recently, Jordbru et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] examined the effect of a 3&#x000a0;week inpatient rehabilitation programme on 60 patients affected by functional gait disorders; they found patients to significantly improve their ability to walk and their quality of life after inpatient rehabilitation compared with the untreated control group. This was the first randomized controlled trial assessing inpatient programme for FNS. Nevertheless, the focus of the programme was physical rehabilitation; occupational therapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy were not provided. In addition, they only included in the study patients with functional gait disorders.</p><p>In this study, we examined prospectively the short- and long-term efficacy of an inpatient multidisciplinary programme for patients with functional neurological symptoms of all types. To do this we used a range of clinician- and patient-rated assessment scales to measure mental health, physical symptoms, every-day function and illness perception. We additionally evaluated the responsiveness of these instruments to patients&#x02019; own self-report of change to determine whether there were baseline predictors of good outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixty-six consecutive patients affected by functional neurological symptoms (FNS) treated within a specialized multidisciplinary inpatient programme between January 2010 and May 2012 was included.

All the patients who accepted programme have an established diagnosis of functional neurological symptoms which has been ascertained by a neurologist and psychiatrist on the basis of clinical presentation and appropriate investigations. To optimize the efficacy of the programme, a few months before the admission patients attend an assessment clinic where they have the opportunity to meet the multidisciplinary team and discuss their diagnosis and the rationale behind the programme. On admission, the treatment plan is individualized and tailored to each patient according to his or her treatment goals. Common features are cognitive-behavioural therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, neuropsychiatry and neurology assessment and input.

This measure is used to help patients identify areas of difficulty in self-care, productivity, and leisure. Following identification of up to five problem areas, patients rate each on a scale from 1 (least important) to 10 (most important). Patients also rate their current level of performance and satisfaction with their performance in each of the five areas on a scale from 1 (with great difficulty or not satisfied) to 10 (with no difficulties or completely satisfied). On re-assessment, patients review their goals and again rate their performance and satisfaction on the goals identified in the initial assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

We found significant improvements in clinician-rated mental health and functional ability. In addition, patients reported that their levels of mood and anxiety had improved and that they were less bothered by somatic symptoms in general and neurological symptoms in particular.</p><p>The effect size for these improvements was greatest for the HoNOS. The HoNOS is a clinician-rated scale devised to assess outcome in people with mental illness and incorporates brief assessments of mental health, social function and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is used routinely in the UK, New Zealand and Australia and increasingly so in other European countries and Canada. A comprehensive review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] concluded that the psychometric properties of the HoNOS are &#x02018;adequate or better&#x02019; indicating that it can be used for monitoring outcomes following treatment. Patients with functional symptoms are prone to many aspects of disability captured by the HoNOS, e.g. mood, cognitive and functional impairments. Our study suggests that the HoNOS is a suitable instrument for detecting meaningful improvement following treatment for functional neurological symptoms.</p><p>The HoNOS, being a clinician rated scale, does not take into account the patient perspective. We therefore, asked patients to rate their outcome using the CGI which asks them to state whether they are &#x0201c;much worse&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;worse&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;not changed&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;better&#x0201c;; &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d;. We then classified patients as improved if they rated themselves as &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;better. Sixty-six percent of patients were classified as improved using this scheme. The change on HoNOS rating following treatment was the only assessment scale able to predict with reasonable accuracy those who rated themselves as improved and not improved at discharge from hospital. This suggests that the HoNOS tallies well with the patients&#x02019; own opinion of their response to treatment, a further validation of the use of the scale for assessing outcomes.</p><p>Self-reported improvements in mood and anxiety measured by the HADS and the degree of distress over symptoms measured by PHQ and CSNQ did not predict whether the patients felt they were better or not at the end of treatment. There were significant improvements in these measures across the group but the effect sizes were small to medium suggesting that these measures were not sensitive enough to self-perceived change. The COPM scores also failed to predict whether patients felt they were better or not. This is a clinician-guided scale enabling patient to set goals and rate their change in performance and their satisfaction. As a change in 2 points is regarded as clinically meaningful, our patient group clearly benefitted from the treatment as they reported a mean of 3 and 4-point change in performance and satisfaction, respectively. Similarly, there were significant changes in the perception of their symptoms following treatment; overall patients understood their symptoms better and felt they were less permanent and disabling. Again these changes did not predict whether they felt better or not.</p><p>Just over 50&#x000a0;% of patients were reassessed 12&#x000a0;months after discharge. Despite these patients having lower HoNOS scores at admission, compared to the group that were not followed-up, their pattern of improvement at discharge from the treatment programme was virtually identical to the group as a whole. These improvements remained stable over the 12&#x000a0;months following discharge for all self-rated measures, and their HoNOS scores continued to improve.</p><p>These data are consistent with the results of retrospective studies of functional movement disorders. For example, Saifee et al. in a different smaller population of patients who completed our programme between 2006 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], assessing a different hospital based programme, found that functional motor symptoms improved in the majority of patients. Our study extends these results by employing a more accurate prospective design, examining long-term outcome by directly contacting the patients 12&#x000a0;months after discharge, and including patients with a range of functional neurological symptoms.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that treatments used for FNS, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], often provide an initial improvement in symptoms but benefits are not maintained in the long-term. In fact, it has been widely described that patients with FNS have a high frequency of relapse or chronicity of the symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our study suggests that a multidisciplinary approach is important for sustained long-term improvement.</p><p>A significant problem for the management of functional neurological symptoms in the UK is that local services are usually unable to accept patients for initial or post-discharge continuing treatment because of the level of demand for their service from neurological patients with organic disorders. An MDT service such as ours is labour-intensive and therefore expensive. Ideally, to optimize the effectiveness of an MDT provision, patients who are likely to benefit from MDT therapy should be identified as early as possible in the care pathway. This is underlined by the finding by Jordbru et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] that physiotherapy-based rehabilitation alone may be effective for some. Unfortunately, none of measures we used at baseline, including the HoNOS, predicted response to treatment as perceived by patients. Our current data therefore suggests that none of these measures could be used to identify which patients are likely to benefit. Alternatively, our measure of patient satisfaction may have been too crude and a dimensional scale such as the CORE-OM may be a better self-assessment tool. This has been validated for patients undergoing therapy and has the advantage of capturing several domains at once including well-being, symptoms and functioning.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p>We acknowledge the limitations of our study: first, we only achieved 1&#x000a0;year follow-up data on 55&#x000a0;% of patients. Second, there are other potential predictors of good or poor outcome that we did not measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; these might be social such as the receipt of health-related financial benefit and the work situation, or psychological such as the presence of dissociative symptoms and the presence of alexithymia (two aetiological markers of FNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Third, the absence of a control group makes it difficult to know to what extent the improvement observed in our patients represented a specific response to treatment intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that a specialized multidisciplinary inpatient programme for FNS can provide long-lasting benefits in the majority of patients. Good outcome at discharge, as rated by the patient, was only predicted by improvement in the HoNOS which continued to improve over the 1&#x000a0;year following discharge. The HoNOS appears to be a suitable tool for the detection of meaningful improvement following multidisciplinary treatment.
