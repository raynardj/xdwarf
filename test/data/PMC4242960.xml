and PNF on pain level, and shoulder ROM in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with painful and limited glenohumeral ROM
activities were selected. The subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group
(n=15), which received treatment consisting of soft tissues mobilization and the PNF
technique. The control group received an ultrasound treatment. Pain level, glenohumeral
external rotation and overhead reach were measured before and after the intervention in
groups. [Results] The experimental group showed a significant reduction in pain level in
comparison with the control group. The values for Shoulder external rotation showed a
significant improvement. The mean value for overhead reach in the experimental group
significantly increased. [Conclusion] The combination of soft tissue mobilization for the
subscapularis for 7 minutes and 5 repetitions of the contract-relax PNF technique for the
shoulder internal rotator muscles followed by 5 repetitions of a PNF facilitated abduction
and external rotation diagonal pattern was found to be effective in reducing pain and
improving glenohumeral external rotation and overhead reach during a single intervention
session.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Shoulder pain</kwd><kwd>PNF</kwd><kwd>Soft tissue mobilization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shoulder impingement syndrome is the most frequent cause of pain and overhead reach
limitation in the shoulder area. It represents the third most frequent disease of the
musculoskeletal system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Normal shoulder
functions are dependent on the scapular humeral rhythm and rotator cuff muscles control<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Disruption of the scapular humeral rhythm
synergistic relationship may occur because imbalance in the shoulder muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subscapularis muscle is the most powerful of the rotator cuff
muscles. It has an important role in shoulder movement and stability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Restriction of shoulder movement in most cases results from muscle spasm, which also
restricts the flow of blood, lymph, and nerve signals in the area<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many treatment methods are practiced clinically of management of shoulder impingement
syndrome. Some studies have shown that manual therapy and soft tissue mobilization may
promote restoration of joint functions after an injury through elongation of shortened
structures, which helps the restoration of range of motion<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Manual therapy may promote
proper restoration of joint function after an injury. As a treatment for shoulder
impingement syndrome, physical therapists often used subscapularis trigger release (STR)
combined with proprioceptive neural facilitation (PNF) procedures, both of which are used to
induce changes in myofascial length. Contract-relax PNF (CRPNF) procedures have been shown
to be effective in increasing shoulder range of motion (ROM)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hold-relax technique is also called the contract-relax
technique and is a technique in which the muscle is stretched isometrically, contracted for
7&#x02013;15 seconds, briefly relaxed for 2&#x02013;3 seconds, and then immediately subjected to a passive
stretch that stretches the muscle even further than the initial passive stretch. This final
passive stretch is held for 10&#x02013;15 seconds. The muscle is then relaxed for 20 seconds before
the PNF technique is performed<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Few studies on glenohumeral external rotation and overhead, reach exist that prove which
treatments are best for immediately minimizing pain in patients with shoulder impingement
syndrome<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of subscapularis
soft tissues and contract-relax PNF techniques on minimization of pain and improving of
glenohumeral external rotation at 45&#x000b0; of abduction and overhead reach activity in patient
with shoulder impingement syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study consisted of experimental randomized controlled trials. The sample size was 30.
The subjects were assigned randomly into two groups by lot method: Group A (n=15) and Group
B (n= 15). The study was carried out with subjects from a physiotherapy outpatient
department. The inclusion criteria included a clear diagnosis of shoulder impingement
syndrome and age between 40 and 60&#x02005;years. In addition, the criteria negative results in the
capsule stretch test, visual analog scale (VAS &#x02265; 5), External rotation = 35&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0;, overhead
reach of 155 &#x000b1;10&#x02005;cm, no use of analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants
within 24 hours before the participation in the study, and positive results in the Neer
impingement test. The subjects with following problems were excluded; open wounds,
infection, acute injuries or fractures, recent surgeries, swelling, rheumatoid arthritis,
reflex sympathetic syndrome, or adhesive capsulitis. All subjects signed informed consent
form designed by the IRB at Majmaah University.</p><p>Subjects were assessed for pain with VAS, range of motion with a Goniometer, and overhead
reach with an inch tape. Measurements of pain, external rotation and overhead reach were
made for all subjects before and after receiving either the experimental or control
intervention. Pain was measured using (VAS). Glenohumeral external rotation was measured
with the subjects lying supine on a treatment table with a pillow under their knees.
Stabilization of the scapula was achieved by depressing the shoulder girdle. Reference lines
for abduction were drawn on the skin over the midline of the sternum and the anterior aspect
of the midline of the humerus. A reference point was also drawn on the skin over the
anterior aspect of the acromion. In addition, a reference line was drawn on the skin over
the ulnar aspect of the forearm. Overhead reach was measured with the subjects in a standing
position facing a wall, with the tips of their toes aligned with a pre marked line on the
floor 30.50&#x02005;cm from the wall. The subjects were asked to actively walk their fingers up the
wall to reach as far as they could. Overhead reach was measured as the distance in
centimeters from the floor to the tip of the middle finger using a tape measure.</p><p>The subjects in the treatment group received soft tissue mobilization (STM) of the
subscapularis, followed by PNF. The subjects were positioned with the humerus abducted to
45&#x000b0; with elbow flexed to 90&#x000b0;, and the humerus was externally rotated to a midrange position,
typically about 20&#x000b0; to 25&#x000b0; of external rotation. The subscapularis was palpated in the
axilla to identify areas of myofascial mobility restrictions, taut bands, or trigger points.
Identified restrictions were treated with STM utilizing a combination of sustained manual
pressure, and slow deep strokes to the subscapularis myofascia for 7 minutes. The STM was
followed by contract-relax PNF for the subscapularis and other glenohumeral medial rotators,
beginning in the same position used for the STM. The patients were instructed to perform
maximal glenohumeral internal rotation against an opposing, isometric, manual resistance
applied by the treating physical therapist for 7 seconds. Afterwards, the patient actively
moved the humerus into full available external rotation. This position was maintained for 15
seconds. This 7-second internal rotation contraction against resistance followed by full
active external rotation was repeated 5 times. Subjects were then instructed to actively
move through the PNF flexion-abduction external-rotation diagonal pattern for 5 repetitions
with manual facilitation. The total time for the described intervention was approximately 10
minutes.</p><p>The subjects were then made to sit in a comfortable position with back support. The arm was
abducted to 45 and the forearm was rested on the pillow for support. Ultrasound (US) therapy
was given to the subscapularis muscle insertion at the shoulder region. The intensity used
was 0.5 watt/ Cmsq, frequency used is 3&#x02005;MHz and the time of the treatment was 10
minutes.</p><p>Immediately after the treatment post reading for pain, external rotation of shoulder and
overhead reach were recorded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The data are expressed as Mean&#x000b1; SD. The probability value less than 0.05 (p value &#x02264; 0.05)

proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitations (PNF) are effective in producing an immediate
improvement in glenohumeral external rotation, at 45&#x000b0; of shoulder abduction and overhead
reach in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.</p><p>The results of this study proved that the STM with PNF is more effective in improving the
glenohumeral external rotation and overhead reach. The subjects of Group A, who underwent
the treatment of STM with PNF were assessed for immediate changes in pain, glenohumeral
external rotation and overhead reach. The study shows significant improvement in pain with
2.8 levels in the VAS and overhead reach up to 12&#x02005;cm in average. When compared with Group B,
who underwent the treatment of ultrasound therapy.</p><p>The results of this study was in agreement with the results was obtained by the research
work done by Joseph J. Godges, et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
main reason for the increase in the range of motion and the overhead reach is that the STM
helps in reducing the tightness and it promotes changes in myofascia allowing the elongation
of the shortened structures.</p><p>PNF is effective in increasing the range of motion and its reciprocal activation of agonist
and antagonist provides the greatest potential for muscle tendon as it lengthens the Golgi
tendon organ which stimulates relaxing the antagonist muscles. When PNF is applied and the
patient is told to contract the muscle in internal rotation against the resistance and the
muscle tension develops, the GTO fibers inhibits alpha motor neurons activity and decreases
tension in the muscle tendon, so for the neuromuscular system, inhibition is the state of
decreased neuronal activity and altered synaptic potential which reflexively diminishes the
capacity of a muscle to contract. As the capacity of muscle to contract decreases the arm is
moved to external rotation, the antagonists are contracted and antagonist muscles are
relaxed and again tension is developed in the agonist muscles. This GTO monitors the
excessive tension during muscle contraction and thus inhibits the excessive
contractions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The shoulder rotation at the position of 45&#x000b0; of abduction was adopted for soft tissue
mobilization and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation because at this position
subscapularis muscle flexibility deficit is major cause than any capsular restrictions which
is mainly the cause of restriction at 90&#x000b0; of glenohumeral external rotation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. While performing the STM, the subscapularis was palpated in the
axilla to identify the areas of myofascial mobility restrictions, taut bands or trigger
points identified restrictions were treated with STM utilizing a combination of sustained
manual pressure and slow deep strokes to the subscapularis myofascia for 7 minutes.</p><p>In Group B (control group) also there was decrease in the pain level, increase in the range
of motion and overhead reach but it is comparatively less than that of Group A.</p><p>Our results is in agreement with Yildirim MA, et al. where their results have indicated
that ultrasound therapy reduces pain and increases the mobility and functional status if
used for many sessions on painful area. The results shows US is statistically less
significance in pain reduction when used for one session on glenohumeral external reduction
and overhear reach.</p><p>Our study confirmed the immediate effect of STM with PNF and significant values for
reduction in pain, increased glenohumeral external rotation and overhead reach were
obtained.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Buss</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name><name><surname>Freehill</surname><given-names>MQ</given-names></name><name><surname>Marra</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Typical and atypical shoulder impingement syndrome:
