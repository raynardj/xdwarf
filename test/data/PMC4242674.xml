BEO exerts anxiolytic, analgesic and neuroprotective activities in rodents through mechanisms that are only partly known and need to be further investigated. To gain more insight into the biological effects of this essential oil, we tested the ability of BEO (0.005&#x02013;0.03%) to modulate autophagic pathways in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. BEO-treated cells show increased LC3II levels and appearance of dot-like formations of endogenous LC3 protein that colocalize with the lysosome marker LAMP-1. Autophagic flux assay using bafilomycin A1 and degradation of the specific autophagy substrate p62 confirmed that the observed increase of LC3II levels in BEO-exposed cells is due to autophagy induction rather than to a decreased autophagosomal turnover. Induction of autophagy is an early and not cell-line specific response to BEO. Beside basal autophagy, BEO also enhanced autophagy triggered by serum starvation and rapamycin indicating that the underlying mechanism is mTOR independent. Accordingly, BEO did not affect the phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser757) and p70<sup>S6K</sup> (Thr389), two downstream targets of mTOR. Furthermore, induction of autophagy by BEO is beclin-1 independent, occurs in a concentration-dependent manner and is unrelated to the ability of BEO to induce cell death. In order to identify the active constituents responsible for these effects, the two most abundant monoterpenes found in the essential oil, d-limonene (125&#x02013;750 &#x000b5;M) and linalyl acetate (62.5&#x02013;375 &#x000b5;M), were individually tested at concentrations comparable to those found in 0.005&#x02013;0.03% BEO. The same features of stimulated autophagy elicited by BEO were reproduced by d-limonene, which rapidly increases LC3II and reduces p62 levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Linalyl acetate was ineffective in replicating BEO effects; however, it greatly enhanced LC3 lipidation triggered by d-limonene.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

This process acts as an adaptive metabolic response by recycling cellular components under conditions of nutrient limitations, and as an intracellular quality control system by promoting turnover of long-lived proteins, removal of damaged organelles, degradation of misfolded and aggregate-prone proteins, elimination of intracellular bacteria <xref rid="pone.0113682-Mizushima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In recent years, converging data have been accumulated linking dysregulated autophagy to diverse pathologies, from cancer to muscle, liver, cardiac, infectious, immune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0113682-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Autophagy defects have been implicated in the accumulation of misfolded disease-causing proteins in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease <xref rid="pone.0113682-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, perturbation of basal autophagy has been involved in neuronal dysfunctions of other central nervous system-related pathologies including glaucoma <xref rid="pone.0113682-Russo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and neuropathic pain <xref rid="pone.0113682-Berliocchi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Defective autophagy has been reported in human tumors with monoallelic deletions of the autophagy gene beclin1 and in cancer cells in which gain-of-function mutations or somatic amplifications in the oncogenes PI3K and Akt lead to constitutive activation of the autophagy-suppressing PI3K/mTOR pathway <xref rid="pone.0113682-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>While the evidence accumulated so far indicates targeting autophagy as an attractive therapeutic approach for different pathologic conditions, this also raises the need for chemical modulators of autophagy to validate this treatment strategy in experimental and clinical settings.</p><p>Here we evaluated the ability of bergamot essential oil (BEO) to modulate autophagy in vitro. Bergamot essential oil (BEO) is a well-known plant extract, obtained by cold pressing of the epicarp and, partly, of the mesocarp of the fresh fruit of bergamot (<italic>Citrus bergamia</italic> Risso et Poiteau). BEO comprises a volatile fraction (93&#x02013;96% of total) containing monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (such as limonene, &#x003b3;-terpinene, &#x003b1;- and &#x000df;-pinene, &#x000df;-myrcene, sabinene, &#x000df;-bisabolene) and oxygenated derivatives (such as linalool, linalyl acetate, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, geranyl acetate), and a non volatile fraction (4&#x02013;7% of total) characterized by coumarins and furocoumarins, such as bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) <xref rid="pone.0113682-Dugo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113682-Mondello1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The most abundant compounds found in BEO are the monoterpene hydrocarbon d-limonene and the monoterpene ester linalyl acetate; among these, d-limonene accounts for about 40% of the whole oil <xref rid="pone.0113682-Mondello2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113682-Verzera2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The essential oil is widely used in perfumery, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries. In the past, BEO has been used as antiseptic and to facilitate wound healing; consistent with this, experimental data have later shown that it possesses antifungal <xref rid="pone.0113682-Romano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113682-Sanguinetti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and antimicrobial <xref rid="pone.0113682-Laird1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> activities and it increases oxidative metabolism in human polimorphonuclear leukocytes <xref rid="pone.0113682-Cosentino1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Well designed clinical trials are needed to conclusively ascertain efficacy and tolerability of BEO in these conditions along with basic research to elucidate its pharmacodynamic profile. The latter point has been addressed by a number of studies which, indeed, documented that BEO may affect synaptic transmission in rodents.

To analyze the autophagic flux, the effects of BEO were studied in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion <xref rid="pone.0113682-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, thus preventing LC3II degradation <xref rid="pone.0113682-Mizushima2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with BafA1, BEO further enhanced LC3II levels as compared with BafA1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113682-g002">Figure 2</xref> B and C) which indicates that BEO induces autophagosome formation. In fact, immunofluorescence analysis of intracellular distribution of endogenous LC3 protein showed that the latter was evenly distributed in vehicle-treated cells, with scattered LC3 punta (autophagosomes) reflecting ongoing (basal) autophagy, whereas a gradual increase in LC3 punctal pattern occurred in cells treated 30 min before with increasing concentrations of BEO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113682-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To determine whether autophagy modulation precedes the occurrence of nuclear alterations on treatment with 0.02% BEO, biochemical and morphological assessment of autophagy was carried out 15 min after BEO exposure. The results show that, at this time, BEO has stimulated the formation of autophagosomes, yet nuclei maintain a normal morphology; further, most of the LC3 puncta colocalize with the lysosomal protein LAMP-1, indicating that autophagosome-lysosome fusion occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113682-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Coincident with this, enhanced LC3II/LC3I ratio and reduced levels of the autophagy substrate p62 were, indeed, revealed by western blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113682-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that 0.02% BEO rapidly stimulates autophagic flux in SH-SY5Y cells and this temporally precedes the profound alterations of nuclear morphology detected at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113682-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To ascertain whether autophagy might have a causative role in cell death triggered by BEO, the latter was evaluated in cells pretreated with the autophagy inhibitor, BafA1. We found that BafA1 given alone did not affected neuroblastoma cell viability nor it protected from cell death induced by BEO; rather, BafA1 caused a trend toward an increase in the percentages of both necrotic and apoptotic cells induced by 0.02% BEO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113682-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0113682-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113682.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Confocal microscopy of DAPI-stained SH-SY5Y cells treated for up to 1 h with BEO.</title><p>SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to the indicated concentration of BEO (0.005&#x02013;0.02%) for 30 or 60 minutes.

These findings demonstrate that autophagy induction is an early response to 0.02% BEO but they are not sufficient to ascribe a causative role for autophagy in cell death induced by the essential oil.

The latter findings are consistent with results obtained by other research groups showing that relatively high concentrations of limonene are required to affect proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines <xref rid="pone.0113682-Bicas1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113682-Rabi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying in vitro antiproliferative effects of limonene are not clearly defined and several mechanisms have been called into question including inhibition of protein isoprenylation and possibly alteration of Ras signaling <xref rid="pone.0113682-Crowell1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, Ras-independent-mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0113682-Karlson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, increase in nitric oxide levels <xref rid="pone.0113682-Manuele1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, ERK pathway activation <xref rid="pone.0113682-Manuele2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, inactivation of Akt <xref rid="pone.0113682-Jia1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Here we provide further insight into the biological activities of this naturally occurring monoterpene by showing that it rapidly modulates autophagic markers in vitro and this occurs at concentrations that can be found in breast tissue of women with early-stage breast cancer taking 2 grams of limonene daily for 2&#x02013;6 weeks (41.3&#x000b1;49.9 &#x000b5;g/g tissue; 332.3&#x000b1;336.1 &#x000b5;M) <xref rid="pone.0113682-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our present observations provide the basis for further investigations to characterize the mechanisms underlying modulation of autophagy by d-limonene.
