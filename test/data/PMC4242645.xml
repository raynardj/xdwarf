DWV contaminates bee products such as royal jelly, bee-bread and honey stored within the infected hive. Outside the hive, DWV has been found in pollen loads collected directly from infected as well as uninfected forager bees. It has been shown that the introduction of virus-contaminated pollen into a DWV-free hive results in the production of virus-contaminated food, whose role in the development of infected bees from virus-free eggs has been experimentally demonstrated. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to ascertain the presence of DWV on pollen collected directly from flowers visited by honeybees and then quantify the viral load and (ii) determine whether the virus associated with pollen is infective. The results of our investigation provide evidence that DWV is present on pollen sampled directly from visited flowers and that, following injection in individuals belonging to the pollinator species <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, it is able to establish an active infection, as indicated by the presence of replicating virus in the head of the injected bees. We also provide the first indication that the pollinator species <italic>Osmia cornuta</italic> is susceptible to DWV infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported in part by European Union FP/Project STEP (Grant n&#x000b0; 244090-STEP-FP) and by Fondi di Ateneo 2013.

One of the most prevalent honeybee viruses is the Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) whose presence is generally related to infestation of the colony by the mite <italic>Varroa destructor</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113448-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. DWV was first isolated in Japan in 1982 from deformed adult honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera L.</italic>); to date its presence has been reported worldwide <xref rid="pone.0113448-de1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The virus belongs to the genus <italic>Iflavirus</italic> and its genome consists of a 10 Kb positive-strand RNA with a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by a long 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032; UTR) and a short, highly conserved 3&#x02032; UTR terminating with a 3&#x02032; poly-A tail <xref rid="pone.0113448-Lanzi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The recent introduction of <italic>Varroa</italic> to Hawaii was followed by an increase in DWV infections and a decrease in DWV diversity suggesting selection for vectoring by <italic>Varroa</italic> as an additional factor contributing to the limited genetic variability so far observed among DWV isolates <xref rid="pone.0113448-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>DWV can be transmitted vertically and persist in the bee colony as covert infection <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Overt infections, characterized by malformed or missing wings, shortened abdomens and premature death leading ultimately to the collapse of the bee colony <xref rid="pone.0113448-de1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, are usually associated with infestation of the apiary by <italic>Varroa destructor</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113448-Ball1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Martin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The mite is not only able to support replication of DWV to high titers, which have been shown to correlate with the development of clinical signs in the bees <xref rid="pone.0113448-Gisder1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but also to activate latent infection in the bee via immunosuppression <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, negatively regulating the expression of a member of the NF-kB gene family <xref rid="pone.0113448-Nazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which plays a central role in insect immunity <xref rid="pone.0113448-Silverman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>DWV has been detected in many bee products, such as larval food, pollen and honey stored in the hive, suggesting that horizontal transmission can also occur through feeding and trophallaxis <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yue2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, DWV-infected workers were shown to develop from DWV-negative eggs in the absence of <italic>Varroa</italic>, but in the presence of contaminated food <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Nordstrm1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Additional evidence that the virus stored in bee-bread and honey was infectious was obtained by feeding virus-free colonies with these virus-contaminated foods, demonstrating that the queen became infected and laid infected eggs <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. DWV was also found in pollen loads collected directly from uninfected forager bees, suggesting that the pollen-associated virus was previously laid on the flowers by infected pollinators <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to ascertain the presence of DWV on pollen collected directly from flowers visited by honeybees and then quantify the viral load and (ii) determine whether the virus associated with pollen is infective. To investigate the first issue we developed a highly sensitive TaqMan one-step qRT-PCR assay based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of DWV and we analysed pollen samples collected from flowers visited by forager honeybees.

The TaqMan one-step qRT-PCR assay we developed targeted the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, with a linear range of amplification over 5 orders of magnitude and a sensitivity sufficient to detect few copies of DWV genome. The virus was readily detected on pollen samples collected from visited flowers of different species, with viral loads comprised between approximately 10 and few hundred copies. It must be emphasized that we did not measure the time of exposure of the flowers to the bee visits neither did we count the number of visits to each flower before the pollen was gathered. The viral particles were associated with the surface of the pollen grains as indicated by the observation that the virus was released into the supernatant after rinsing the pollen with PBS. This observation is consistent with previous results obtained on pollen pellets collected from forager bees <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our data provide evidence that the virus is released on flower pollen by bees during their foraging activity. How the virus is transferred from the bee to the pollen is still unclear: it may likely occur via random deposition of virus-contaminated feces on the flowers <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, as well as through contact between contaminated pollen load carried by the visiting bee and flower pollen. The virus-contaminated flower pollen samples identified in this study indicate that the virus is widely distributed in the environment outside the hive. Our finding along with previously reported experimental evidence of cross-species transmission of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) from honeybees to bumble bees via common visits to flowers <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, strongly suggests the role of pollen in the dissemination and transmission of DWV and other viruses. This transmission, which is believed to occur not only among honeybee colonies but also to other pollinators, is probably more relevant than previously thought.</p><p>It has been shown that the introduction of virus-contaminated pollen into a DWV-free hive results in the production of virus-contaminated food, whose role in the development of infected bees from virus-free eggs has been experimentally demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Nordstrm2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although the viral load resulting from the uptake and manipulation of virus-contaminated pollen may be low, it could however with time, via repeated ingestion by larvae as well as adult bees, lead to a covert infection of the colony. Infestation of such a colony by Varroa mites, regardless of the presence or absence of the virus within the mites themselves <xref rid="pone.0113448-Shen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, will be likely to activate virus replication, via immunosuppression of the honeybee humoral and cellular antiviral immune responses <xref rid="pone.0113448-Nazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, leading to the onset of an overt, symptomatic infection.</p><p>However, it has not yet been elucidated whether the virus present on flowers, specifically on flower pollen, is infective, despite the exposure to potentially adverse environmental conditions.</p><p>To help elucidate this point we performed DWV injection experiments in adult individuals of two species, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Osmia cornuta</italic>, which circulate and pollinate within the same area, sharing their foraging sites.</p><p>The <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> colony selected for the injection experiment tested DWV- negative by qRT-PCR during the last two years (unpublished results). When, shortly before the injection experiment, a control was performed on dissected heads and abdomens of a representative sample of the colony, all bee heads were negative, whereas most abdomens unexpectedly turned out to be weakly positive. Since it is widely accepted that active infection is characterized by the presence of replicating virus in the head <xref rid="pone.0113448-Yue2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Mckel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Zioni1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, we decided to use this colony for the injection experiment and to assess presence and replication of the injected virus exclusively in the head. All <italic>Osmia cornuta</italic> individuals analysed before the experiment tested completely negative, allowing us to assess presence and replication of injected DWV both in the abdomen and in the head.</p><p>
<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Osmia cornuta</italic> bees belonging respectively to groups aC and oC were injected with visited flower pollen supernatant while individuals belonging to groups aD and oD received supernatant from an enriched sample of pollen load collected from the foragers at the entrance of the hive. Two reasons determined this experimental choice. Firstly, Singh et al. <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> found DWV RNA in pollen loads of uninfected bees, as well as infected bees carrying uninfected pollen loads, and no obvious clustering of pollen load-derived viral sequences with the viral sequences found in the respective forager. These findings suggest that the virus found in pollen loads was most likely previously deposited on the flowers by infected pollinators. Secondly, the enriched pollen load inoculum carried tenfold more viral particles than the flower pollen inoculum, providing a higher possibility of success for the injection assay.</p><p>Injection of flower pollen supernatant produced detectable infection in the head of two <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> bees, with viral loads just above the lower limit of detection of our assay. This was not surprising, considering the very low number of viral particles injected (1.4&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>To this point it is important to mention that the number of viral particles used for this experiment was several orders of magnitude lower than previously shown to be necessary to reproducibly establish detectable DWV infection, i.e. DWV RNA signal in the head <xref rid="pone.0113448-Mckel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although enriched tenfold with respect to the flower pollen inoculum, the pollen load inoculum carried only 1.3&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> copies of DWV; nevertheless viral RNA was found in the head of three honeybees, of which one had died one day p.i. and two were sacrificed at day 10. Viral loads were low, except for one of the bees sacrificed at day 10, which carried 1.4&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> copies of DWV genome, well above the number of copies present in the inoculum.</p><p>In agreement with the results of Mockel et al. <xref rid="pone.0113448-Mckel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, all bees belonging to group aE, which received 3.8&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> virus particles, were DWV positive, with viral loads comprised between few units and 3.7&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> copies of viral genome, irrespective of the time interval between injection and sampling. The strand-specific RT-PCR assay gave clear indication that the virus associated with flower pollen was actively replicating, as negative strand RNA was found in the head of bee aC6, sacrificed at day 10 p.i. No detectable replication was seen in the bee which died at day 1 p.i., a result which could be explained by assuming that this time interval was too short for the viral replication to produce a number of progeny genomes sufficiently high to be detected by our strand-specific nested RT-PCR. Similarly, viral replication was promptly detected in the head of bees aD7 and aD8, sacrificed at day 10 p.i., whereas only genomic RNA was present in bee aD3, which died at day 1 p.i. Replicating virus was found in most bees belonging to the positive control group aE.</p><p>The finding that visited flower pollen was infectious prompted us to perform an additional experiment with a twofold purpose: to assess the statistical significance of the results obtained in the first experiment, by injecting and analysing a higher number of bees and to compare the infectivity of DWV present in flower pollen, pollen load and infected bee-derived supernatants. To assess the statistical significance of the results obtained with these groups, UFP1-infected bees were used as a negative control group. Significant difference was found between all virus-injected groups and the negative control group whereas no significant difference was found between the infectivity of VFP1, PL1 and IB1 supernatants. In agreement with the results of the first experiment, after the first few days p.i., replicating virus, which is the hallmark of an active infection, was promptly detected in the head of the infected bees. These results confirm that DWV from flower pollen is able to establish an active infection in honeybee, irrespective of bee's age and of season, and strengthen the data about environmental stability of DWV <xref rid="pone.0113448-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and of other picornaviruses exposed to sunlight, dessication and temperature fluctuations <xref rid="pone.0113448-Rzezutka1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113448-Quan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Although Osmia bees were not infected by flower pollen under the experimental conditions used in this study, our results represent the first evidence that the species <italic>Osmia cornuta</italic> is susceptible to DWV infection, as shown by the evidence of viral replication occurring in the abdomen of the individuals injected with the IB extract.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that deposition of DWV on flowers by infected forager honeybees may significantly contribute to the dissemination of the virus in the environment, representing a source of infection for other pollinators as well.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Cesare Biondi for the palynological analysis, Raffaele Cirone, president of FAI (Italian Beekeepers' Association), who set up the Gorgona apiary, Roberto Papucci for making the Gorgona apiary honeybees available for our investigation and Riccardo Antonelli for scansion electron microscopy images.
