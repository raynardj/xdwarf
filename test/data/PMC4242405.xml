Numerous health conditions may affect medical decisions regarding tolerance of breast radiation therapy. These factors must be considered during the decision-making process after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy for breast cancer.

Underlying medical issues may introduce additional complexity. Indwelling cardiac devices, a history of RT, or underlying medical or genetic disorders may all affect patient tolerance of RT, and these factors must be considered in surgical decision making. In this review of the literature, we describe potential medical factors that affect the use of adjuvant RT in the setting of a breast cancer diagnosis and provide the best current medical evidence that can be used to assist providers and their patients in the surgical decision-making process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijwh-6-945">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>For this review, we conducted a PubMed search, English language only, with no date limitations, followed by abstract review of select relevant articles. The following search terms or combination of terms was used: radiation, breast cancer, complications, prior radiation, Hodgkin lymphoma, implanted cardiac devices, coronary artery disease, radiation pneumonitis, connective tissue disease (CTD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, vitiligo, genetic mutation, BRCA1/2, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Cowden syndrome. The influence of RT on these factors and disease processes and its impact on decision making is summarized in this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular factors</title><p>Tangential fields used with standard whole-breast RT for left-sided breast cancer may affect the heart and result in delayed complications from RT.

Patients receiving left-sided treatment had the most significant cardiac effects,<xref rid="b9-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with a latency of 10 to 20 years. Patients treated from 1973 through 1979 had a 15-year cardiac mortality rate of 13%. Patients treated from 1985 through 1989 had a 15-year cardiac mortality rate of 5.5%. Further improvements in delineating and avoiding cardiac radiation should continue to improve survival. Anticipating the risk of current techniques is difficult, given the apparent latency period of at least 10 years before clinical outcomes become evident. However, a modern study that defined cardiac risk based on dose and treatment volume of the heart shows the excess cardiac events appear to be closer to 0.5% to 3% greater than for age-matched controls if the dose to the heart is minimized with computed tomographic planning and modern techniques.<xref rid="b7-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Additional factors can influence the risk of cardiovascular complications after RT for breast cancer. The combination of RT and chemotherapy has a higher risk of cardiovascular complications than RT alone.<xref rid="b5-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A similar increase in cardiovascular complications is seen in smokers undergoing RT compared with nonsmokers.<xref rid="b10-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, other studies have not shown adverse cardiovascular effects from RT. Wang et al<xref rid="b11-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reported that among patients receiving RT who subsequently underwent coronary angiography (median, 4.2 years later), patients with left-sided breast cancer did not have increased risk of coronary artery disease compared with patients with right-sided disease. The authors of that study acknowledged that they could not exclude late development of coronary stenosis. In another study, Park et al<xref rid="b12-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported no significant difference in cardiac events in an average of 8 years after RT for left-sided vs right-sided ductal carcinoma in situ, but the authors noted that longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late events. These reports did not evaluate the incidence of cardiac events in patients not receiving RT. In a report assessing the location of disease after RT, coronary stenosis was observed most often in the left anterior descending and diagonal artery, indicating a direct association between the RT field and stenosis location.<xref rid="b13-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The above data support use of RT after breast-conserving surgery but also suggest that it is prudent for providers to educate patients about ongoing measures to reduce long-term cardiac risk factors.</p><p>No studies have evaluated the risk of worsening existing coronary artery disease in women undergoing RT for breast cancer. However, the magnitude of increased risk of coronary disease appears to be independent of preexisting risk factors.<xref rid="b7-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Currently, no guidelines suggest withholding RT from women with underlying coronary artery disease who desire breast-conserving therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Implanted cardiac devices</title><p>Implantable cardiac pacemakers (ICPs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) introduce additional complexity because they are sensitive to radiation. Guidelines for management of patients with ICPs requiring RT were published in 1994<xref rid="b14-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> but have not been updated and do not address ICDs or modern RT modalities. The majority of data regarding the impact of RT on ICPs and ICDs is from case reports and small case series. The lack of a large body of evidence is compounded by the seemingly conflicting findings of some authors who identified harmful effects<xref rid="b15-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and others who did not,<xref rid="b17-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> particularly when the device was outside the treatment field or when pretreatment device relocation was undertaken. Nevertheless, adverse effects have been reported, even when the device is located outside the treatment field.<xref rid="b16-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A retrospective study of 33 patients with an ICD who received RT<xref rid="b15-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was prompted by a patient with prostate cancer who was found to have a malfunctioning ICD. Subjects were treated from 2005 through 2007 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and either had the device relocated or the treatment dose limited. Only one patient had an adverse device effect. A retrospective review of Mayo Clinic patients undergoing RT from 2002 through 2007 with the device outside the therapeutic field also found no evidence of reset or malfunction during or after RT.<xref rid="b19-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The authors concluded that malfunction or device reset due to scatter radiation is likely a rare, unpredictable occurrence.</p><p>Patients with breast cancer receiving RT generally are accepted to have some risk of adverse device effects, and appropriate precautions therefore should be taken before starting RT. Implanted cardiac devices are not considered a contraindication to breast RT; we recommend that the device be relocated outside of the treatment field whenever possible, and dose limits should not be exceeded. Close collaboration with a cardiologist can determine device dependency and need for safe device relocation. A minimum distance from the treatment field has not been established, although one group suggests at least 4 cm.<xref rid="b20-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Many device manufacturers publish recommended device radiation dose limits. Patients should be closely monitored by device function evaluation before, during, and after RT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary factors</title><p>Radiation pneumonitis is a known potential adverse effect of pulmonary RT.<xref rid="b21-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis occurs in less than 1% of all patients undergoing breast RT and generally occurs 4 to 12 weeks after therapy is complete.<xref rid="b5-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Most patients have a self-limited course that does not require treatment, and corticosteroid treatment is rarely required in patients with persistent symptoms.

In patients receiving tangential radiation, the risk of grade 2 pneumonitis (symptomatic, medical intervention indicated, limiting instrumental activities of daily living) was 0.2% vs 1.3% in patients receiving comprehensive nodal radiation, which included the internal mammary chain.<xref rid="b26-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Long-term pulmonary function is generally unaffected.<xref rid="b5-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In general, no pulmonary conditions absolutely contraindicate use of RT for breast cancer. In view of the potential for pulmonary complications, lung comorbidities should be noted in the evaluation of patients with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Connective tissue disease factors</title><p>Controversy is ongoing regarding risk of RT-related toxicity in patients with CTD. The degree of toxicity may vary significantly, depending on lymphovascular involvement of the specific CTD process, the presence of collagen deposition in subcutaneous fat, and intimal involvement of the vascular system. Most of the available information is from studies that included a wide range of patients receiving RT for various malignancies.</p><sec><title>Rheumatoid arthritis</title><p>Morris and Powell<xref rid="b27-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reviewed the records of 209 patients with CTD treated with RT from 1960 through 1995. Average follow-up was longer than 6 years (range, 2 months to 32 years). Of these, 131 patients (60%) had RA. Those without RA had diagnoses such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyositis or dermatomyositis, scleroderma or &#x0201c;calcinosis, Raynaud, esophagus, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia&#x0201d; (CREST) syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile RA, discoid lupus, and mixed CTD (MCTD). Approximately 10% of patients in both groups had a diagnosis of breast cancer. Patients received 10 to 87.6 Gy of RT (mean, 45 Gy). The authors concluded that acute effects of mucositis, dysphagia, and skin changes were similar in both groups. Patients with RA had late effects, such as cardiac toxicity, small-bowel obstruction, and tissue fibrosis or necrosis, commensurate with a normal population undergoing RT, whereas patients with non-RA connective tissue disorders had a high risk of significant late toxicity (6% vs 21% at 5 years [<italic>P</italic>=0.002]). Late toxicity in these patients included toxicity to the bowel and pelvic organs, tissue fibrosis or necrosis, and central nervous system toxicity. The toxicity was confined to the radiation field and depended on the area treated. Patients who used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during RT had a lower risk of late RT-related complications (6% vs 11% [<italic>P</italic>=0.04]). Patients using corticosteroids, high-dose salicylates, or methotrexate had a lower risk of late RT complications than those not receiving medical therapy during RT, but these were not statistically significant differences.<xref rid="b28-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> RT dose, tobacco use, and nonmalignant comorbidities had no significant impact on acute or chronic toxicities related to RT.</p><p>Ross et al<xref rid="b28-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> undertook a similar matched-pair case-control study and noted only a nonsignificant increase in acute and chronic effects of RT in patients with CTD. However, the number of patients with breast cancer was not clearly identified in this study. Thus, underlying RA does not appear to be a contraindication to RT for breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Mixed connective tissue disease</title><p>Mayr et al<xref rid="b29-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> described a patient with MCTD who had severe skin toxicity associated with RT for occult breast cancer with axillary presentation. This patient had early, severe, prolonged, and moist desquamation (injury to the basal layer of the epidermis). Additionally, late RT changes of fibrosis developed; they were thought to be caused by vascular injury within the dermis and typical of similar changes noted in the setting of systemic sclerosis and SLE. Although the data are insufficient to determine the impact of RT in patients with MCTD and breast cancer, we advise that such patients with MCTD be educated about the lack of evidence regarding the safety of RT when considering breast-conserving therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Systemic lupus erythematosus</title><p>A large series by Pinn et al<xref rid="b30-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> described 21 patients with SLE treated with varying types of RT for malignancy between 1985 and 2003. Two patients had breast cancer, and one was noted to have grade 2 desquamation. The authors concluded that SLE did not preclude the use of RT.</p></sec><sec><title>Scleroderma</title><p>Gold et al<xref rid="b31-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> studied 20 patients with systemic scleroderma treated with RT from 1980 through 2003 to identify treatment-related toxicities. Average follow-up was 4.7 years (range, 4&#x02013;22.6 years), and of the three patients with breast cancer, one had chest wall radiation and two received orbit and spine radiation. Limited acute toxicity developed in three patients, but pronounced acute skin reactions (greater than grade 3) was not noted. Furthermore, grade 1 or 2 late toxicity of tissue fibrosis, necrosis or ulceration, xerostomia, and hyperpigmentation were noted in 12 patients. Grade 3 or higher toxicity occurred in four patients and included ileus and wound infection; one patient with esophageal cancer had severe mediastinal fibrosis. In another study investigating 36 patients with CTD who received radiation after lumpectomy for breast cancer, the four patients with scleroderma had a significantly increased incidence of RT-related complications of marked fibrosis in the treatment field, leading to the need for mastectomy in two of the three patients with severe late complications.<xref rid="b32-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Thus, for patients with scleroderma, consultation with a radiation oncologist and rheumatologist, to discuss risks and benefits of RT, should be undertaken before surgical decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Psoriasis</title><p>Charalambous and Bloomfield<xref rid="b33-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> reported a case of exacerbation of psoriasis after palliative breast RT for metastatic adenocarcinoma. They discussed the Koebner phenomenon (KP), which is the skin changes (vitiligo or psoriasis in this case) that develop in areas of previously unaffected skin, due to skin trauma (eg, from radiation, physical trauma, surgical incisions, psoralen-ultravioletA, or sunburn). KP is also known as an isomorphic response because the skin changes noted in damaged areas are reflective of those elsewhere on the body. Psoriasis is most commonly associated with the isomorphic response and has a reported incidence of 38% to 76%, occurring 7 to 14 days after the injury.<xref rid="b34-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Other skin conditions, including vitiligo, lichen planus, and active eczema, are associated with KP but to a lesser degree. With the advent of skin-sparing external-beam RT, the incidence of KP has decreased compared with several decades ago. For patients with psoriasis who prefer a lumpectomy, we recommend consultation with a radiation oncologist before surgical decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitiligo</title><p>In 2007, Munshi et al<xref rid="b35-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> described a 42-year-old woman with untreated vitiligo who had RT-induced depigmentation. After a modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, she received 45 Gy to the chest and axilla over 4 weeks. At her 6-month follow-up evaluation, she reported depigmentation in the irradiated fields. This example of KP was believed to be caused by radiation-induced apoptosis of susceptible melanocytes. Several cases have been reported, and the possibility of depigmentation should be discussed between the patient and the radiation oncologist.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Prior radiation therapy</title><p>When evaluating a patient with newly diagnosed, early-stage breast cancer who is considering breast conservation, a careful history regarding previous chest RT must be obtained as part of surgical decision making.</p><sec><title>Prior breast radiation therapy and subsequent in-breast recurrence</title><p>Approximately 10% of patients treated with lumpectomy and RT will have in-breast recurrence during long-term follow-up those with favorable tumor biology have a less than 5% risk of recurrence, but those with unfavorable biology have closer to a 10% risk.<xref rid="b36-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Mastectomy is the standard of care for cancer in a previously irradiated breast because another course of RT is contraindicated (unacceptable soft-tissue toxicity).

A limited number of publications have reported patient outcomes after a second lumpectomy followed by RT, usually in patients refusing mastectomy. The radiation techniques used include low-dose-rate brachytherapy (in which the radiation source is positioned in the breast using radioactive seeds),<xref rid="b38-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> high-dose-rate brachytherapy (in which catheters are loaded with an isotope, such as iridium 192, and inserted into the breast),<xref rid="b39-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> or external-beam RT.<xref rid="b41-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Brachytherapy and partial breast radiation techniques may be feasible in some patients, but their use depends on multiple patient and tumor factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Low-dose-rate brachytherapy</title><p>Chadha et al<xref rid="b38-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> described 15 patients with localized breast lesions who underwent a second lumpectomy and received low-dose brachytherapy. The first six patients received a dose of 30 Gy. With no unacceptable acute toxicity observed, the brachytherapy dose was increased to 45 Gy. The authors reported low complication rates after a median follow-up of 36 months, a high rate of local control, and freedom from mastectomy. The cosmetic results were described as good to excellent for all patients. Trombetta et al<xref rid="b39-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> examined the feasibility of using the MammoSite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> brachytherapy applicator in the retreatment of three patients with breast cancer that was previously irradiated. With a mean follow-up of 32 months, no patient had a local recurrence develop, and cosmesis was reported as excellent.

Toxicity and dose were clearly associated, with grade 2 and 3 complication rates of 0%, 28%, and 32% with brachytherapy doses of 30 Gy, 45 to 46 Gy, and 50 Gy, respectively. Although 27.5% had no long-term adverse effects (grade 0), 50.7% experienced grade 1 (toxicity not requiring symptomatic medical treatment), 11.6% had grade 2 (toxicity requiring symptomatic medical treatment), and 10.2% had grade 3 (toxicity requiring surgical intervention) effects. The complications observed were as follows (some patients had several complications): fibrosis in 16 cases (23.2%), breast retraction in six cases (8.7%), telangiectasia in five cases (7.3%), necrosis requiring surgery in two cases (2.9%), association between the above complications in 15 cases (21.7%), and other complications in six cases (8.7%).

As partial breast RT limits radiation to only the portion of the breast at risk for subsequent malignancy, use of partial breast RT in patients previously treated with whole-breast RT potentially limits radiation-induced toxicity. Several external-beam partial breast RT techniques have been described.<xref rid="b43-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b45-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The advantage of utilizing three-dimensional conformal external-beam RT is that it is less invasive than brachytherapy, and most radiation facilities in the United States already have the tools required for this method of RT delivery.</p><p>In summary, mastectomy is still the accepted standard of care for patients who have received prior RT to the chest or breast for various reasons. Patient requests for breast-conserving therapy in these situations need careful evaluation of various factors (eg, tumor size, time from previous RT, previous radiation dose and fields, willingness to proceed with other adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy and hormonal therapy), and shared decision making by the patient and radiation oncologist. Medical comorbidities and life expectancy also must be considered. Further investigation is needed to determine whether RT is a safe and acceptable alternative to mastectomy for managing early stage breast cancer for patients with a history of RT. Currently, in most situations, repeat irradiation should not be routinely offered and may be considered only for institutional review board-approved protocols, with stringent eligibility criteria and clearly defined radiation techniques and follow-up for patient outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>History of Hodgkin lymphoma</title><p>Mastectomy is the most widely accepted surgical treatment for breast cancer in patients who were previously treated with mantle RT. This is primarily based on concerns regarding possible severe sequelae arising in the breast from a high total cumulative dose of RT, both from standard RT for breast cancer and from treatment delivered to portions of the breast for Hodgkin lymphoma. Nevertheless, with significant improvement in radiation techniques and the advent of partial breast irradiation, the question of breast-conserving treatment in this group is being reevaluated.<xref rid="b46-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b49-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p><p>Additionally, other factors need to be considered. Chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma also leads to cardiac toxicity that is additive with RT to the heart from Hodgkin treatment and from breast treatment. The prior radiation field can help determine which areas would be receiving RT again. Chadha et al<xref rid="b46-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> described five patients with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymphadenectomy (with or without axillary dissection) followed by low-dose interstitial brachytherapy. At follow-up (range, 5&#x02013;67 months), all five patients had an intact breast without evidence of relapse. No patients had infection, and no skin toxicities greater than grade 2 were observed. All patients were reported to have excellent cosmetic results.</p><p>Deutsch et al<xref rid="b48-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> described 12 women treated with RT (with or without chemotherapy) for Hodgkin lymphoma (n=11) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=1) with development of breast cancer 10 to 29 years later. Patients underwent lumpectomy and whole-breast RT with a boost to the operative area. Six also received adjuvant chemotherapy. Breast RT was reported to be well tolerated and not associated with any unusual acute or chronic sequelae. All women had good to excellent cosmetic results. Ten women were alive and well 1 to 174 months (median, 46 months) after completion of RT. Two women died of distant metastasis without local recurrence. The authors concluded that breast conservation with RT is not contraindicated by previous RT for lymphoma.</p><p>These reports of small case series are encouraging, and although treatment of lymphoma is also evolving, the standard of care for women with breast cancer after prior mantle RT is still mastectomy. For patients with a history of RT who are keen to pursue breast conservation, it is vital that they meet with the radiation oncologist before surgery to receive further education regarding options and to facilitate optimal decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic factors</title><p>Ionizing radiation can cause genetic damage, including mutations, chromosomal aberrations, DNA strand breaks, and chromosomal instability in normal cells.<xref rid="b50-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> For women with hereditary germline mutations involving genes associated with DNA repair (eg, <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> [<italic>BRCA1/2</italic>] mutations, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Cowden syndrome), the potentially increased risk of subsequent malignancy due to RT must be considered in surgical decision making.</p><sec><title><italic>BRCA</italic> mutations</title><p><italic>BRCA1/2</italic> genes are involved in DNA repair,<xref rid="b51-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and as ionizing radiation damages DNA,<xref rid="b52-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> there is concern about exposing <italic>BRCA</italic> carriers to therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation. Outcomes after therapeutic RT in women with <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation are conflicting.

This study demonstrated that breast RT did not increase the rate of an ipsilateral breast cancer in these high-risk women.<xref rid="b53-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Similar results were noted by Kirova et al in 2010.<xref rid="b54-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> After more than 13 years of follow-up, the rate of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence was no different among women with <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations who had breast-conserving treatment vs those with sporadic breast cancer who had similar treatment (36% vs 33%, respectively [<italic>P</italic>=0.42]). Metcalfe et al<xref rid="b55-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> also reported a reduced rate of breast cancer recurrence after RT in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> carriers.

Both Haffty et al<xref rid="b56-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and Garcia-Etienne et al<xref rid="b57-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> found higher local recurrence after RT in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> carriers compared with the sporadic breast cancer controls. In the study by Haffty et al,<xref rid="b56-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> the women had 12 years of follow-up before the difference was observed (49% vs 21%, respectively [<italic>P</italic>=0.007]), whereas the study by Garcia-Etienne et al<xref rid="b57-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> observed a divergence in recurrence rates after 5 years (15% vs 4%, respectively [<italic>P</italic>=0.03]). Together, these studies support the hypothesis that RT to the chest increases risk of future breast cancer in women with <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations. Although we consider the patient&#x02019;s preference in these situations, we generally advise women with breast cancer who carry the <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation to undergo a therapeutic mastectomy (and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy).</p></sec><sec><title>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</title><p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with an increased risk of malignancies, most commonly breast cancer, sarcoma, brain tumors, and adrenocortical cancers.<xref rid="b58-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> It is associated with heterozygous germline mutations in the <italic>p53</italic> tumor suppressor gene, which controls apoptosis and DNA repair.<xref rid="b59-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> In laboratory experiments, ionizing radiation on human lymphoblast cells causes defective cell arrest and interferes with normal apoptosis.<xref rid="b60-ijwh-6-945" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></p><p>In a 2001 case report of a woman who underwent mastectomy and RT of the axilla and supraclavicular lymph nodes and later RT to the ovaries, the authors noted that within 8 years after RT, small-cell lung cancer and colon adenocarcinoma were detected in the original radiation fields.

Six of the eight women had received postoperative RT, three after lumpectomy and three after mastectomy. After 6 years of follow-up, only one patient had contralateral breast cancer, and it was one of the two women who had not received RT. Of the women who had received RT, three ipsilateral and four contralateral breast cancers were identified. A chest wall angiosarcoma and a breast histiocytofibrosarcoma were also reported, both of which were radiation induced.

Whole-breast RT has demonstrated improved survival and decreased risk of locoregional recurrence and is considered part of definitive treatment of breast cancer after lumpectomy. Postmastectomy RT also reduces breast cancer recurrence risk and improves survival in select patients. Overall, adjuvant RT is well tolerated by patients; very little acute toxicity is reported, and for most patients, late toxicity is minimal as well. In this review, we summarized the medical factors that must be considered during surgical decision making to balance benefits and risks of therapeutic options. Providers must be aware that although RT rarely is absolutely contraindicated, it also has the potential for long-term adverse effects. Women must be counseled appropriately by a multidisciplinary team, including a radiation oncologist, regarding their choices during the breast cancer treatment decision-making process.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
