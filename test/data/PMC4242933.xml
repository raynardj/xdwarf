Various studies have been conducted to
improve the walking ability in stroke, as recovery of walking ability is a rehabilitation
goal for most stroke patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Treadmill training was suggested to be an effective method for improving the walking
ability in stroke in a systematic review<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Olney et al. demonstrated that treadmill training is a type of forced use and that it also
could improve both quality and quantity aspects of walking<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance ability is an important factor for independent walking in stroke patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
For stable and functional walking, increasing the balance ability is a prior to other
capacity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Numerous interventions have
been devised to improve balance, such as unstable surface training (UST)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, balance training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and virtual reality programs<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. UST in particular has been proven to improve the strength,
proprioception, and balance ability of the lower extremity<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some authors have reported that UST increased the weight bearing
ratio by more in the affected lower limb in stroke patients<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. UST has also been shown to
positively influence muscle activation and improvement of balance ability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, most of the studies that have been conducted to date have only evaluated the
effects of UST on balance ability. Little is known about the effects of UST on lower
extremity function, especially walking performance for independent living in stroke
patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether UST influences
walking ability during treadmill training in stroke patients.</p><p>We hypothesize that a UST and with treadmill training group will show greater improvements
in the 10-meter walk test, Timed Up and Go test, and 6-minute walk test compared with a
control group performing treadmill training alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 12 poststroke individuals admitted to a rehabilitation hospital in the
Republic of Korea. They were randomized into two groups by a physical therapist not involved
in the study: the experimental group also performed UST after treadmill training, with the
UST being performed for 10 minutes; the control group performed treadmill training only. The
inclusion criteria were (1) history and clinical presentation (hemiparesis) of stroke (first
hemorrhage or infarction), (2) more than 1&#x02005;year post event, (3) gait speed over 0.5 m/s,
enough to exercise on a treadmill, (4) not training in any interventions related to gait
concurrently from other institutions, (5) independent gait possible over 10 m, and (6)
sufficient cognition to participate in the training, that is, a: Mini-Mental State Exam
(MMSE)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> score of 21 or higher. The
exclusion criteria were (1) any comorbidity or disability other than stroke that precluded
gait training and (2) any uncontrolled health conditions for which training is
contraindicated. Participation in the study was voluntary, and the subjects fully understood
the contents of this study. Written informed consent, after providing an explanation of the
study purpose and the experimental method and processes, was obtained from all patients. The
study was approved by the Daejeon University institutional review board.</p><p>A 10-m walk test (10-MWT) was performed by walking 10&#x02005;m to measure the gait speed<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The walkway was 14&#x02005;m long, including a
2-m section for acceleration and a 2-m section for deceleration, and it has been used in
other studies. The participants were asked to walk as fast and as safely as they could. Gait
speed was measured with a stop watch. The participants were asked to walk 3 times, and the
average round-trip time was recorded.</p><p>The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) was used as a dynamic balance test<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This test records the time taken to rise from a chair
(height: 50&#x02005;cm), walk 3 m, turn around a marker, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The
participants were asked to walk 3 times, and the average round-trip time was recorded.</p><p>The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was used as an endurance test<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were asked to walk as fast as they could for 6
minutes. Walking capacity was monitored using a standardized protocol. Distance walked (m)
was measured by the assessor. The test was performed in a 100-m-long corridor.</p><p>Twelve people fulfilled the criteria and voluntarily agreed to participate in this study.
The participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group (n<sub>1</sub> = 6) or
control group (n<sub>2</sub> = 6). The intervention comprised 4 weeks of inpatient
treatment. Participants in the experimental group performed the UST using the method of
Verhagen et al. The participants in the experimental group used a balance mat (Aeromat,
Ironcompany, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA). The UST program consisted of (1) forward reaching
in a sitting position on the balance mat (10 times), (2) maintaining a standing position on
the balance mat (30 seconds), (3) squatting exercise on the balance mat (10 times), (4)
marching in place on the balance mat (30 seconds), (5) lifting the heels of a foot on the
balance mat (30 seconds), and (6) forward reaching in a standing position on the balance mat
(10 times). Both groups performed one session (30 minutes) a day (5 days/week) of treadmill
training. The groups were randomized to the treadmill exercises and performed 30 minutes of
supported walking exercise. The treadmill was equipped with hand railings and included a
sensor that would stop the treadmill if there were any problems with balance or safety. The
treadmill exercise was conducted with the treadmill in a flat position. The speed was set to
the lowest stage and increased within the first minute to the working stage. The working
load was increased to a stage that the participants felt comfortable with. After the
treadmill exercise, the participants finished the training with deep breathing and simple
stretching.</p><p>All the collected data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0. Descriptive and analytical statics
are presented. Independent t-tests were used to compare differences between group means, and
paired t-tests were used to compare within-group means. Data are presented as the mean and
standard deviation (SD). Differences between categorical variables were analyzed using the
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test. Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All patients completed the intervention and assessments. There were no significant

element for promoting social interaction and for improving quality of life through
participation in social activities and activities of daily living<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of UST
in improving walking ability. The results of this study were as follows: (1) Both groups
showed significant differences in the 10-MWT, TUG and 6-MWT results after treadmill
training. (2) The experimental group showed a significant difference from the control group
for the TUG and 6-MWT results. Treadmill exercise effectively improved the performance in
both groups, and the additional effects of UST suggest that it would be an efficacious
method in rehabilitation.</p><p>A previous study showed that UST increased muscle endurance and postural control compared
with training on a typical surface<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These results were similar to our results, as we found significant differences in the TUG
and 6-MWT. Shin et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that
improvement of balance could affect walking ability. On the basis of that TUG was used as a
dynamic balance test<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was suggested
that the UST would improve balance ability<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study is in agreement with the above results. Irion reported
that UST improved dynamic balance compared with training on a stable surface<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the experimental group
showed better improvement in the TUG than the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). These results
support the previous study. In the current study, the 6-MWT was used to evaluate
improvements in endurance during walking. For independent living, stroke patients have to be
able to walk more than 300&#x02005;m. In our study, the participants were unable to walk 300&#x02005;m in
the pretest. In the posttest, the experimental group showed significant improvements
compared with the control group in the 6-MWT (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, the participants in both
group were still unable to walk 300&#x02005;m in the 6-MWT. Although UST resulted in significant
differences in dynamic balance and walking endurance between the groups, walking speed was
not significantly different. We think that these results seemed to indicate improved dynamic
balance and endurance. UST with treadmill training is a useful intervention for improving
dynamic balance and walking endurance.</p><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of UST in chronic stroke patients. The
results of this study indicate that UST improved walking ability and suggest the
applicability of UST for clinical rehabilitation. Improvement of walking ability in stroke
patients increases the opportunities for independent living and social activities. In
addition, it can be an effective approach to ensure continuous training after discharge. The
UST protocol has a clinical advantage because it is simple and easy. In addition, UST is
cost-effective because of the enhanced efficiency achieved by its use in combination with
traditional methods. The limitations of this study include the relatively small groups and
the absence of follow-up data. Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Wonkwang Health Science University Research Fund (2014).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bang</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of action observational training on walking
