However, type I collagen is overexpressed in a large number of cancers, and, paradoxically, a high expression is correlated with an increased risk of metastasis, for instance in breast and lung cancers (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ramaswamy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gilkes et al., 2013</xref>). Collagen overexpression is not the only factor involved in cancer progression. Indeed, the size, diameter, morphology, and cross-linking of type I collagen fibrils have an impact on tumor cell proliferation and metastatic growth (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Levental et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, type I collagen fibrils promote the activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ruangpanit et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We previously discovered that type I collagen fibrils are powerful and physiological inducers of invadosomes, which are F-actin&#x02013;rich structures able to degrade the ECM (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>). The term invadosomes refers to podosomes in normal cells as well as to invadopodia in cancer cells. Both are matrix-degrading structures allowing matrix remodeling and cell invasion due to the activity of MMPs such as MMP2, MMP9, and MT1-MMP (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hoshino et al., 2013</xref>). Invadosomes in some cancers correlate with their ability to metastasize (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Eckert et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, invadosomes were recently involved in tumor cell extravasation and demonstrated to be a therapeutic target for metastasis (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Leong et al., 2014</xref>). Invadosome formation, organization, and activation are controlled by RhoGTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Moreau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Martino et al., 2014</xref>) and also by Src kinases (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tarone et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Linder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hauck et al., 2002</xref>). The invadosome basic module corresponds to a central F-actin core composed of actin-binding proteins like neuronal Wiskott&#x02013;Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP), the Arp2/3 complex, and cortactin, which is associated with scaffold proteins such as Tks5 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Destaing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Linder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>). This actin core may be surrounded by a ring of regulating proteins like integrins, vinculin, and talin. Invadosomes are found as individual items, aggregates, or organized into &#x0201c;rosettes&#x0201d; according to cellular models and context. They are constitutive in various cancer cells and in osteoclasts, but in most cell types they are absent in basal conditions, although inducible by various stimuli including cytokines (PDGF, VEGF, and TGF-&#x003b2;) or various compounds (phorbol esters, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, and sodium fluoride; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albiges-Rizo et al., 2009</xref>). Our recent data showed that type I collagen fibrils induce invadosome formation in most cell types tested, such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Moreover, type I collagen fibrils promoted a linear reorganization of invadopodia in cancer cell lines, which was associated with an increase in ECM-degrading activity. Invadosomes induced or reorganized by collagen I aligned along the collagen fibers, and we thus called them linear invadosomes. Two studies have confirmed the induction of linear invadosomes upon cell contact with collagen fibrils (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Monteiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Schachtner et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, although &#x003b2;1 integrin family members are the major receptors for type I collagen (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2011</xref>) and are associated with classical invadosomes in many cell types, we found that they were not necessary for linear invadosome formation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>), raising the question about the ECM receptor involved.</p><p>Discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) are a ubiquitously expressed family of receptors known to interact with collagens, in particular fibrillar collagens I&#x02013;III (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). DDRs only bind collagens in their native physiological triple-helical conformation and do not recognize denatured collagens such as gelatin (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). The DDR receptor family belongs to the large group of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and is composed of two members, DDR1 and DDR2. Ligand interaction with DDRs promotes tyrosine autophosphorylation as with classical RTKs, although with very slow and persistent kinetics (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). The DDRs are considered to be collagen sensors and act on tissue homeostasis, as well as on many cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell adhesion, cell migration, and invasion (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). These latter properties clearly connect them with cancer. Indeed, several recent studies show that the DDRs are often up-regulated in various cancers (for review see <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Valiathan et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, DDR1 was found overexpressed in lung and breast cancers (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ford et al., 2007</xref>), where a high expression level was correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis formation (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Valencia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Miao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because both DDR1 and collagen I are overexpressed in cancers and associated with metastasis development, and as type I collagen fibrils promote linear invadosome formation, we hypothesized that DDR1 could be the collagen I receptor involved in the formation of linear invadosomes and subsequent cellular invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>DDR1 drives linear invadosome formation and activity</title><p>For this study, we selected breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines with high levels of DDR1 expression. We found that MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells, derived from human breast and lung cancers, respectively, express DDR1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404079/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). We first analyzed the formation of invadopodia in these cells. As shown by dual F-actin/cortactin immunostaining on fluorescent gelatin, A549 cells do not form constitutive invadopodia, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Consequently, only MDA-MB-231 cells degrade gelatin in the in situ zymography assay. However, when seeded on collagen I fibrils, both cell types were able to form linear invadosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>). These dynamic structures formed along collagen fibrils are composed of F-actin, cortactin, and Tks5, which are classical markers for invadosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404079/DC1" id="supp2">Video 1</ext-link>). These results confirm our previous data demonstrating that type I collagen fibrils reorganized invadopodia from MDA-MB-231 cells into linear invadosomes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we show that type I collagen fibrils strongly induced linear invadosomes in cancer cells that do not exhibit constitutive invadopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In MDA-MB-231 cells, the invadosome reorganization was also associated with an increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and was correlated with an increase in the global degradation activity of cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404079/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Altogether, we show that cancer cells expressing DDR1 can form linear invadosomes when plated on type I collagen fibrils and that contact with type I collagen fibrils increases the ability of the cells to degrade the ECM.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DDR1-expressing cells form linear invadosomes.</bold> (A) A549 (left) and MDA-MB-231 cells (right) were cultured on FITC-gelatin for 24 h.

Two to three distinct siRNAs were used to deplete DDR1 in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404079/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S2, A&#x02013;C</ext-link>), and linear invadosomes were quantified upon plating on type I collagen fibrils. We found that depletion of DDR1 promoted a significant decrease in the percentage of cells able to form linear invadosomes in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S2, B and C). It also strongly decreased the number of linear invadosomes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), altogether highlighting a major role of DDR1 in linear invadosome formation. To confirm these data, we performed a rescue experiment. We found that lentiviral-mediated expression of DDR1-GFP restored linear invadosome formation in cells transfected with a DDR1 siRNA, which is associated with a colocalization between Tks5 and DDR1 (Fig. S2, D and E). We have previously shown that collagen I&#x02013;induced linear invadosomes were able to degrade not only gelatin but also collagen I fibrils themselves (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>). Using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy that allows collagen fibril visualization without any staining, we thus quantified the consequences of DDR1 depletion on collagen fibril degradation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gailhouste et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, the decrease of linear invadosome formation was correlated with a decrease in the cell capacity to degrade type I collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate the critical role of DDR1 in the formation and activity of type I collagen-induced invadosomes.</p><p>These results raised the question about a potential role of DDR1 in the formation and function of classical invadosomes. We thus silenced DDR1 in MDA-MB-231 and Huh6 cells, which both exhibit constitutive invadopodia. Interestingly, whereas we were not able to localize DDR1 at invadopodia, we found that decreasing DDR1 expression using two different siRNAs altered invadosome formation and decreased cell degradation capacity in MDA-MB-231 and Huh6 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404079/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>DDR1 kinase activity is not required for linear invadosome formation and activity</title><p>As DDR1 is a tyrosine kinase receptor, we investigated the involvement of DDR1 kinase activity in linear invadosome formation and degradation function. To this end, we used nilotinib, developed as a Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor but later shown to inhibit DDR1 kinase activity highly efficiently (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2008</xref>). We first confirmed using immunoprecipitation that type I collagen promoted DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation and that nilotinib almost completely abrogated it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We found however that nilotinib treatment did not affect linear invadosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B&#x02013;D</xref>). Indeed, type I collagen stimulation was still able to reorganize F-actin along fibrils, and Tks5 remained associated with the structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Because type I collagen fibrils are part of the tumor microenvironment, we studied whether DDR1 was involved in the invasion of a 3D collagen gel by linear invadosome-bearing tumor cells. We first demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 cells were able to form linear invadosomes in a 3D collagen gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). We further used an invasion assay (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2005</xref>) consisting of a type I collagen gel polymerized into Boyden chambers. Gels were polymerized at a 1 mg/ml concentration of type I collagen at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. In this condition, cells need proteolysis to invade the gel according to the study of <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al. (2013)</xref>. Cells were seeded on top of the collagen gel and fixed after 1 h and 3 d. We confirmed that DDR1 depletion remained constant over the studied time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Using quantitative confocal z-stack analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>), we found that DDR1 depletion blocked the cell&#x02019;s ability to invade the collagen gel. In the control condition, approximately half of the cells were able to invade the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). In contrast, DDR1 down-regulation abolished cell invasion. Confocal analysis showed that after 3 d, most of the DDR1-silenced cells remained stacked at the gel surface and did not enter into the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). To control that cells used a proteolysis-dependent mode of migration to invade the collagen gel, we used an MMP inhibitor, GM6001. We found that GM6001 totally blocked the cell&#x02019;s ability to penetrate the gel, demonstrating the MMP involvement in this process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201404079/DC1" id="supp8">Fig. S5, A and B</ext-link>).

As PP2 and nilotinib treatments did not inhibit type I collagen degradation in 2D (Fig. S4), we also checked for cell invasion in 3D in these conditions. PP2 treatment did not have an impact on cell invasion, whereas nilotinib treatment only induced a slight decrease in the cell capacity to invade the collagen gel (Fig. S5, A and B).

Herein, we confirmed our previous findings showing the importance of type I collagen fibrils as powerful invadosome inducers (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>) and extend them to cancer cells. Most cell types are able to form linear invadosomes, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, cancer cells, Src-transformed cells (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>), or, as shown by another group, megakaryocytes (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Schachtner et al., 2013</xref>). We demonstrated that the simple contact of cancer cells with type I collagen fibrils can promote formation of linear invadosomes and consequently activate their capacity to degrade the ECM. In the case of cancer cells constitutively exhibiting invadopodia, type I collagen fibrils induced their reorganization into linear invadosomes, increased the percentage of cells presenting linear invadosomes as compared with classical invadopodia, and also increased the capacity of the cells to degrade the ECM. Owing to their capacity to localize the degradation machinery along fibrils, linear invadosomes could be implicated in the proteolytic breakdown of the ECM, which favors invasive migration, either in physiological conditions such as angiogenesis, or in pathological situations such as cancer. Thus, there is a great interest in developing our understanding of the molecular pathways required for the formation and function of linear invadosomes.</p><p>Although integrins are required for the formation and activity of classical invadosomes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Destaing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Beaty et al., 2013</xref>), we found that they are not necessary for linear invadosome formation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>), thus raising the question of the identity of the collagen receptor responsible for their formation. Four major classes of vertebrate transmembrane receptors are known to interact directly with the native collagen triple helix: collagen-binding &#x003b2;1 integrins, DDRs, glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2011</xref>). Our own data eliminated &#x003b2;1 integrins (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>). Because GPVI is present only on platelets and LAIR-1 on leukocytes, we turned our attention to the DDRs, which are ubiquitously expressed.</p><p>We found that DDR1 colocalized within linear invadosomes, and, using a RNAi approach, found that it was involved in their formation and in their ability to degrade type I collagen fibrils. These results establish DDR1 as the collagen I receptor required for linear invadosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>) and raise the question of DDR1&#x02019;s role in classical invadosomes. We showed that DDR1 depletion decreased classical invadosome formation and activity. Importantly, the effect of DDR1 on classical invadosomes was observed on gelatin, which is not known as a DDR1 substrate. Accordingly, we were unable to colocalize DDR1 with classical invadosomes. However, these data suggest an involvement of DDR1 in classical invadopodia. Because DDR1 controls integrin activation (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), it could modulate invadosome formation and activation directly or indirectly. Moreover, DDR1 and integrins present common signaling pathways, which suggests a cooperative action to form classical invadosomes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Shintani et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>DDR1 controls linear invadosome formation via Tuba-dependent Cdc42 activation.</bold> Schematic representation of linear invadosome architecture and molecular composition.

We demonstrated, using nilotinib as an inhibitor as well as blocking antibodies, that DDR1 kinase activity is not necessary for the formation of linear invadosomes. This is in agreement with our previous observations. Indeed, we found that linear invadosomes already appear within 10 min of cell seeding on type I collagen, a kinetic that is not compatible with DDR autophosphorylation, a slow process requiring &#x0003e;30 min before being detectable (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, it was previously shown that the role of DDR1 in promoting collective migration was also independent of its kinase activity (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011</xref>). In our hands, the lack of requirement for c-Src activity, demonstrated with both a pharmacological antagonist and the use of SYF cells, is also in line with these findings because it was shown that c-Src was necessary for the full DDR phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dejmek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, although c-Src has been historically associated with invadosomes, our data show that collagen I&#x02013;induced invadosomes are independent of c-Src activity. Thus, linear invadosomes are the first described c-Src kinase&#x02013;independent invadosomes.</p><p>How then does DDR1 signal for invadosome formation? As the RhoGTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been largely involved in invadosome formation and organization, we investigated their role in DDR1-dependent linear invadosome formation. We clearly showed that only Cdc42 is involved. This is supported by the drastic effect of Cdc42 silencing, the blockage of collagen I&#x02013;induced Cdc42 activation in cells transfected with DDR1 siRNAs, and the localization of the active form of Cdc42 (GFP-V12Cdc42 protein and Cdc42 biosensor) at linear invadosomes. Conversely, the GFP-N17Cdc42 dominant-negative form decreased the cell&#x02019;s ability to form linear invadosomes on collagen and did not colocalize with linear invadosomes. Most invadosome models are controlled and regulated by several Rho-GTPases. Our results are thus important, as only very few models have been described so far in which only Cdc42 and not RhoA or Rac1 are implicated in invadosome formation. This specificity of linear invadosomes, together with their restricted molecular composition, which we reported previously (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Juin et al., 2012</xref>), supports the idea that collagen-induced invadosomes correspond to a minimal form of invadosomes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Martino et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, another study showed that overexpression of tagged forms of DDR1 in MDCK cells decreased Cdc42 activation by collagen (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2009</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may be relevant to explain why MDCK cells are unable to form linear invadosomes and to degrade the ECM upon collagen stimulation (unpublished data).</p><p>Altogether, our data demonstrated that collagen I&#x02013;induced invadosomes rely on a DDR1, Cdc42-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). We further identified Tuba as the major Cdc42GEF involved in linear invadosome formation. Several other Cdc42GEFs such as FGD1 or Vav1 were shown to be involved in invadopodia formation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ayala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Razidlo et al., 2014</xref>), but this is the first demonstration of the involvement of Tuba. Moreover, Tuba colocalized with DDR1 into linear invadosomes but not with classical invadosomes, which allowed us to identify Tuba in addition to DDR1 as a specific marker of linear invadosomes. Tuba is a 177-kD protein containing four SH3 domains in its N terminus: a central GEF domain, followed by a BAR domain and two SH3 domains in the C terminus (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cestra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). The involvement of Tuba is in line with the involvement of N-WASP in linear invadosomes, as Tuba was shown to be involved in N-WASP&#x02013;dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Salazar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs et al., 2006</xref>). Though we describe here the involvement of Tuba in MDA-MB-231 and in A549 cells, it is now clear that each cancer cell expresses its own pattern of GEFs among the 70 RhoGEFs in the human genome, (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Razidlo et al., 2014</xref>), which suggests that other GEFs may also be involved in linear invadosome formation according to the cell type. In addition, the link between DDR1 and Tuba is probably not direct, as we were not able to show an interaction between both proteins. Indeed, other DDR1-interacting proteins could also be involved. For instance, on one hand several studies have identified DDR1 partners previously linked to the invadosome machinery (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>), like PYK2 (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Shintani et al., 2008</xref>), Nck2 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2006</xref>), and PI3K (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dejmek et al., 2003</xref>), whereas others found DDR1-interacting partners that bind DDR1 regardless of its phosphorylation status, like Syk (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dejmek et al., 2005</xref>), E-cadherin (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011</xref>), and the Par3/Par6 cell polarity proteins (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011</xref>). Further studies will tell if these proteins are involved in the role of DDR1 on linear invadosome formation and activation.</p><p>In our study, we confirmed the role of DDR1 in cell invasion. However, interestingly, we established that inhibition of Src with PP2 or of DDR1-kinase activity with nilotinib did not affect drastically type I collagen degradation and cell invasion. This differs from the findings from other studies showing an impact of PP2 treatment on cell invasion (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Angers-Loustau et al., 2004</xref>). This point could be explained by the conditions used to perform these assays such as the use of a non&#x02013;type I collagen matrix, the collagen source, or the absence of serum starvation. It is clear that the kinase activity of the receptor is crucial for DDR1 signaling that promotes, for example, cell proliferation. But we demonstrated here that cells can sense type I fibrils and start a degradation process independent of its kinase activity and in the absence of a requirement for c-Src.</p><p>Thus, upon contact with type I fibers, DDR1 is able to recruit the actin machinery associated with a strong matrix degradation activity. Although the proteolytic mechanisms used by linear invadosomes are still being investigated, a recent study has shown that the Scar homologue (WASH) and the exocyst complex are involved in delivering MT1-MMP&#x02013;positive late endosomes focally to linear invadosomes (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Monteiro et al., 2013</xref>). It is well known that MMPs, such as pro-MMP2, can be activated by the culture of cells on fibrillar collagen I (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Azzam and Thompson, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ruangpanit et al., 2001</xref>) in an MT1-MMP&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Takino et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we propose that DDR1 is the sensor used by tumor cells to interact with fibrillar collagen I, leading to the organization of invadosomes that concentrate the proteolytic machinery of the cells to facilitate invasiveness. Because of its capacities to stimulate cell invasion and its overexpression in different cancers, DDR1 should be a good target for the prevention of metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies, reagents, and constructs</title><p>Nilotinib, anti-Tks5 (rabbit, M-300), anti-DDR1 (rabbit, C-20), anti-GAPDH (mouse, FL-335), anti-myc (mouse, 9E10), and anti-RhoA (mouse, 26C4) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
