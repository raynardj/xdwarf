However, non-target-dependent amplification has limited the sensitivity of isothermal technologies and complex probes are usually required to distinguish between non-specific and target-dependent amplification. Here, we report a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, Strand Invasion Based Amplification (SIBA). SIBA technology is resistant to non-specific amplification, is able to detect a single molecule of target analyte, and does not require target-specific probes. The technology relies on the recombinase-dependent insertion of an invasion oligonucleotide (IO) into the double-stranded target nucleic acid. The duplex regions peripheral to the IO insertion site dissociate, thereby enabling target-specific primers to bind. A polymerase then extends the primers onto the target nucleic acid leading to exponential amplification of the target. The primers are not substrates for the recombinase and are, therefore unable to extend the target template in the absence of the IO. The inclusion of 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA to the IO ensures that it is not extendible and that it does not take part in the extension of the target template. These characteristics ensure that the technology is resistant to non-specific amplification since primer dimers or mis-priming are unable to exponentially amplify. Consequently, SIBA is highly specific and able to distinguish closely-related species with single molecule sensitivity in the absence of complex probes or sophisticated laboratory equipment. Here, we describe this technology in detail and demonstrate its use for the detection of <italic>Salmonella.</italic>

More recently, numerous isothermal amplification technologies, which obviate the use of the sophisticated laboratory hardware required for thermal cycling, have been developed <xref rid="pone.0112656-Craw1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112656-Asiello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112656-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A disadvantage of isothermal technologies is that, in common with PCR, they tend to produce non-specific amplification products. Non-specific amplification results either from binding of the primers to non-target nucleic acids or from direct copying of one primer onto another, a phenomenon known as primer dimers <xref rid="pone.0112656-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These events result in non-specific exponential amplification and non-productive consumption of assay components, leading to reduced yield, sensitivity, and/or specificity. In contrast to PCR, the rate of artifactual amplification in isothermal technologies is not aligned with that of the target region throughout the thermal cycle. This can result in non-target-specific products being more rapidly amplified than the target and subsequently overwhelming the reaction, with a further reduction in sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0112656-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112656-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>To retain specificity, several isothermal amplification methods, including HDA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Vincent1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, RPA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Piepenburg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, NASBA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Compton1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, QPA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, RCA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Demidov1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, SDA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and NEAR/EXPAR <xref rid="pone.0112656-VanNess1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, as well as PCR <xref rid="pone.0112656-Heid1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, have been developed to incorporate complex target-specific probes into the reaction to allow distinction between target-specific and non-specific amplification products; however, this does not prevent the sensitivity of the tests from being jeopardized. The isothermal technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), is an exception that relies on a set of primers, usually between four and six, and a strand displacement polymerase <xref rid="pone.0112656-Notomi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although LAMP has exceptional analytical sensitivity and specificity, the method can also suffer from non-specific amplification because of the use of numerous large primers that act as polymerase substrates, resulting in the potential for false-positive results <xref rid="pone.0112656-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112656-Uemura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, Strand Invasion Based Amplification (SIBA), which is inherently resistant to non-specific amplification and, consequently, sensitive for a single target molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The technology relies on the recombinase-dependent insertion of a single-stranded, invasion oligonucleotide (IO) sequence into a complementary region of a target duplex DNA. The DNA duplex proximal to the IO insertion is disrupted, enabling the binding of target-specific primers, which are not recombinase substrates. A polymerase can then extend the template from the bound primers. Hence, the orchestrated recombinase-dependent insertion of the IO and subsequent polymerase-dependent extension of the primers provide the basis for exponential isothermal amplification. The inclusion of 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA into the sequence of the IO ensures that it is neither a substrate nor a template for the polymerase <xref rid="pone.0112656-Stump1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and it cannot take part in artifactual amplification. Furthermore, since the primers are not recombinase substrates, they are also resistant to the formation of artifacts because they cannot dissociate a duplex in the absence of the IO. These characteristics ensure that amplification occurs only in the presence of the target template. The absence of side reactions ensures that the technology is sensitive to a single copy of a target without the use of target specific probes.</p><fig id="pone-0112656-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112656.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mechanistic description of the SIBA reaction.</title><p>All single-stranded elements are coated with gp32, except for the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA nucleotides.

Step 2: The IO invades the complementary region of the target duplex which allows partial separation of the target duplex with the downstream end still remaining double-stranded. The out-going strand of the partially separated target duplex is stabilized by gp32. Step 3: UvsX depolymerization allows the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region of the IO branch migrates into the duplex. Step 4: Both the upstream and downstream region peripheral to the IO also become short enough to dissociate. Step 5: The strand displacement polymerase is able to extend the dissociated target duplex from the primers. The forward primer displaces the IO during extension of the target template.

The IO separates the target duplex and peripheral sequence allowing the primers to bind and extend the target duplex.

The IO was 60 nucleotides in length and comprised a non-homologous upstream (seeding) region of 14 nucleotides; this ensured optimal coating of the homologous portion by the recombinase. In addition, the downstream region of the IO comprised 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA nucleotides to ensure that it was not a viable polymerase substrate or template <xref rid="pone.0112656-Stump1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The assay was performed under SIBA reaction conditions as described in the &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; section, and real-time amplification was monitored using SYBR Green I dye. The amplification reaction was detected and expressed as the threshold detection time (dt), which was the time at which the SYBR Green I fluorescent signal exceeded the background signal. Amplification of the target template only occurred in the presence of a homologous IO. The average dt for 10<sup>7</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> target copies was approximately 14 and 18 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Based on these dt values, the estimated amplification doubling time was calculated to be as low as 35 seconds.</p><p>A distinct band of approximately 70 bp corresponding to the amplification product, appeared only in reactions that contained the target template, IO, and primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). This was confirmed by melting curve analysis, which indicated the presence of a single reaction product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). No amplification was detected in samples without the target template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 4), demonstrating that non-specific amplification products were absent. A band consistent with the IO remained visible in all reactions containing IO. This confirmed that the IO is not consumed in the SIBA reactions and does not form part of the amplified product, but rather was utilized only for dissociation of the target DNA. To further confirm that the recombinase insertion process was sequence-specific, the homologous IO was replaced with a non-homologous IO (a functional IO homologous to a different target DNA sequence). The non-homologous IO was unable to induce amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> lane 8), demonstrating that the insertion process, and consequently the SIBA reaction, is sequence-specific. In addition, neither the homologous IO, nor the primers were able to induce amplification of the target DNA on their own. The primers in the samples in which target-specific amplification occurred were no longer visible on gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). This implies that these primers were totally consumed in the reactions, further demonstrating the efficiency of the reaction. By contrast, the primers were not consumed in reactions performed in the absence of either a homologous DNA template or homologous IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6 and 8&#x02013;10). These findings also demonstrate the absence of non-specific amplification events, such as primer-dimer artifacts. This is likely due to the inability of primer dimers to amplify target sequences, since the primers alone are not recombinase substrates and are therefore unable to invade a duplex. Consequently, amplification is only achievable through homologous insertion by the IO. For a non-target sequence or artifact to be amplifiable, it would need to comprise a sequence region homologous to the IO as well as the primer binding sites. This is a plausible event and was avoided by the inclusion of a 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region within the IO as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The importance of the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region for sensitivity and specificity</title><p>The invasion oligonucleotide (IO) sequence used to invade and dissociate the target duplex contained 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA modifications at the 3&#x02032;-end and was homologous to the target duplex <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The presence of this modification was critical to the sensitivity and specificity of the reaction. The SIBA reaction is designed such that, after insertion of the DNA region of the IO into a homologous duplex, the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region branch migrates further into the duplex, such that approximately 12&#x02013;16 nucleotides (depending on the sequence) of the duplex remain peripheral to the insertion site. The target duplex peripheral region is defined by the primer region which is non-homologous to the IO. Hence the primers are designed such that their region non-homologous to the IO is approximately 12&#x02013;16 nucleotides in length.</p><p>During the first round of amplification, the primers are able to extend the initial target template added to the reaction (via the action of a polymerase), creating amplicon whose peripheral regions corresponds to the primer length (the length that is non-homologous to the IO). Under the reaction conditions used, target duplex with peripheral regions of this length dissociates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s007">Fig. S7</xref>), resulting in complete separation of the target duplex. This allows efficient binding and extension of the target duplex by both primers via the action of a polymerase during each round of amplification. It is, therefore, critical that the length of the amplicon regions peripheral to the IO insertion site is short enough to dissociate under SIBA reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). A longer area peripheral to the insertion site results in incomplete dissociation of the target duplex due to the higher melting temperature; thus, very weak or no amplification takes place (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s004">Figs S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s007">S7</xref>). Likewise, if the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl region does not branch migrate, or the primer binding site (i.e the non-homologous region) is too long, amplification will also be very weak or absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s004">Figs S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s007">S7</xref>).</p><p>SIBA primers are designed to be 16&#x02013;23 nucleotides long (depending on the sequence) with the 3&#x02032;-end also homologous to the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region of the IO, such that only 12&#x02013;16 nucleotides remain peripheral (non-homologous to the IO) to the insertion site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This configuration ensures efficient amplification of the target DNA and minimizes the risk of non-specific amplification. This is because the complete sequence of the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region is homologous only to the target DNA and cannot be created by the action of the primer/polymerase since this region is not a polymerase substrate. Therefore, a non-specific template will not contain a region homologous to the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA and cannot therefore be efficiently separated by the IO, leading to weak or no amplification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s004">Figs S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s005">S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s007">S7</xref>).

Such a IO (with a non-homologous 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region) is unable to branch migrate into the target duplex; therefore, the residual duplex, even after insertion of the IO DNA region, remains too long to dissociate. This results in only partial dissociation of the target duplex, compromising the binding site for the amplification primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s005">Figs S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s007">S7</xref>). Interestingly, IOs that completely lacked a 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region (SB-IO NON-METH) tended to produce detectable, albeit weak, amplification, as well as some non-specific artifacts. Despite the 3&#x02032;-terminating nucleotide base (reversed dT), it is plausible that the reaction is not complete, resulting in some extendible IOs and the production of artifacts. Replacement of the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA modification with natural DNA nucleotides (SB-IO DNA) also permitted amplification but led mainly to the generation of non-specific amplification products. Since the reverse primer is partly complementary to the 3&#x02032;-end of the IO, it is able to bind to and enable the extension of the IO to create an amplifiable duplex in either the presence or absence of a target template. This emphasizes the importance of a IO that is not a substrate for polymerase.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The sensitivity of SIBA extends to a single point mutation</title><p>Complete dissociation of the target duplex upon invasion by the IO is required for efficient amplification.

The effect was slightly more accentuated when the single point mutation was located in the region homologous to the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region rather than in the DNA region (&#x00394;dt&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11.7 and 7.4 minutes respectively). The rate of IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA branch migration is likely to become less efficient when it is not fully homologous to the template, a feature essential for efficient amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). With respect to a point mutation in the region homologous to the IO DNA region, it is likely that the recombinase can tolerate at least one incorrect base without preventing invasion. This could be an advantage in situations in which the detection of closely-related targets that differ by one or a few bases is required. Furthermore, it is plausible that the polymerase error rate would eventually induce a mutation that would revert the amplification product to the correct template sequence. The dt increased further as the number of point mutations increased. A template with double point mutations at regions homologous to the IO DNA region showed a further delay in dt (&#x00394;dt&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24.0 minutes). Interestingly, a template containing double point mutations at regions homologous to the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl region did not amplify; therefore, the change in dt could not be determined. No amplification was observed in reactions containing templates harboring three or four point mutations located in either the region homologous to the IO DNA or in the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA site. Discriminating a single point mutation is only achievable via real-time detection, since DNA targets that differ by a single point mutation are still detected in SIBA reactions even though they differ in detection time. Discriminating two or more point mutations maybe more reliable since double point mutations located at regions homologous to the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl region can abolish amplification.</p><p>The result could also serve as a tool for designing SIBA assays that require inclusivity or exclusivity of closely related targets. When detecting all closely related target DNA that differs by 1 or 2 nucleotides is of interest, then SIBA assays could be designed such that the location of the point mutation (s) on target DNA is homologous to the DNA region of the IO. On the other hand, if detecting a particular target DNA with the exclusion of other closely related targets that differ by 2 or more nucleotides is of interest, then SIBA assays could be designed such that the location of the point mutation (s) on target DNA is homologous to the IO 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region. This is due to the fact that the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region of the IO appears to be more sensitive to point mutation than the DNA region on the IO.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Application of SIBA to detect <italic>Salmonella</italic> at single molecule sensitivity without amplifying closely-related species</title><p>Here, we demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of SIBA technology by amplifying the InvA gene from <italic>Salmonella</italic> genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

SIBA eliminates non-specific amplification because, in contrast to other systems such as RPA and HDA, SIBA primers cannot bind to or allow the extension of a template in the absence of IO <xref rid="pone.0112656-Piepenburg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, any artifacts produced during the SIBA reaction are amplified very inefficiently compared with the target-dependent reaction.</p><p>The SIBA reaction relies on a complex sequence of events and, consequently, avoids the formation of amplifiable artifacts. An oligonucleotide (IO) invades a duplex DNA via the action of a recombinase. As a result, the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region (which forms the 3&#x02032;-terminus of the IO molecule) branch migrates further into the duplex. This leaves only a short intact region of the duplex, which then completely dissociates to enable the amplification primers to bind and be extended by the polymerase. The primers cannot independently bind the target duplex in the absence of the IO as they are not recombinase substrates. The IO can neither be amplified nor extend the target duplex since it is not a substrate for polymerase.</p><p>It is plausible that, on occasion, a primer could copy onto the IO and then, through a process of strand switching, further copy onto another primer. This would induce an amplifiable artifact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Such a configuration would rely on the primers being short enough to leave only a small peripheral duplex should they be incorporated into an artifact, enabling complete dissociation of the duplex during amplification. The challenge here was to design a system in which the primers would be too long for amplification to occur when incorporated into an artifact, but short enough to enable amplification of the target of interest. The solution was achieved using primers bearing 3&#x02032;-ends homologous to the IO. In this configuration, the primer leaves only a short peripheral region when the target DNA is amplified, but a long peripheral region when incorporated into an artifact. Although the 3&#x02032;-end of the reverse primer is complementary to the IO, it lies within the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl RNA region, which is not a template for polymerase <xref rid="pone.0112656-Stump1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; therefore, there is no risk that the primer will extend this region. Even a single base change in the 2&#x02032;-O-methyl region inhibited its ability to branch migrate. Consequently, SIBA is not only highly sensitive due to its resistance to non-target-dependent amplification, but is also highly specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112656-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112656-t001">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112656.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). It is difficult to theoretically predict what the ideal melting temperatures of these primers should be since this is strongly influenced by the SIBA buffer conditions, particularly the presence of gp32. However, we found that primers up to 23 nucleotides long, with around 14 nucleotides non-homologous to the IO, are ideal for SIBA. One strategy for achieving the ideal primer length is to design several primers (e.g., four forward and four reverse primers) that differ in their lengths of homologous and non-homologous regions relative to the IO insert. These primers are then tested in various combinations in the presence or absence of the target DNA and IO. The ideal primer combination can then be chosen based on their ability to efficiently amplify the target DNA.</p><p>The SIBA reaction includes a recombinase, recombinase cofactors, and an energy generating system, as well as the nucleic acid components and polymerase.

It is also important to ensure that the oligonucleotides used in SIBA are of a high quality and (preferably) HPLC purified, since a truncated IO might still be able to invade the target but will lead to poor amplification due to its inability to dissociate the duplex. This will result in competition with the competent portion of the IO preparation. The optimum concentrations of the recombinase, UvsX, and accessory proteins used in SIBA differ from one target analyte to another. This may be because UvsX shows differing affinity for different DNA molecules, which is dependent on length as well as composition. For example, UvsX binds preferentially to pyrimidines <xref rid="pone.0112656-Formosa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, at the high concentrations of UvsX used in SIBA, UvsY was not necessary and can be inhibitory, which is consistent with previous findings <xref rid="pone.0112656-Morrical1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The ability of oligonucleotides &#x02265;25-mer to support invasion in the presence of recombinase is consistent with previously reported data <xref rid="pone.0112656-Piepenburg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112656-Formosa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>SIBA and RPA<xref rid="pone.0112656-Piepenburg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> depend on the application of the recombinase UvsX during the amplification process. The primers used in RPA are substrates for the recombinase which induces their insertion into the target duplex. In contrast, the primers used in SIBA are short and consequently are not recombinase substrates. They were shown to be unable to invade the target duplex on their own. In SIBA, a non-extendible invasion oligonucleotide (IO) is the recombinase substrate and is inserted between the two primer binding sites. This results in the separation of the duplex peripheral to the IO insertion site enabling the primers to bind and extend the target DNA via the action of a polymerase. The IO is neither consumed nor takes part in the extension of the target DNA. The advantage of this process is that, due to the incompetence of the primers alone in SIBA as well as the non-extendible nature of the IO, primer artefacts are abolished. These characteristics ensure that SIBA is able to detect a single copy of target DNA without generating non-specific amplicons. Such sensitivity is not usually achievable with isothermal methods, since the generation of non-specific amplification products is prominent at low target copy numbers or in the absence of a target DNA <xref rid="pone.0112656-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For example, amplification of a DNA target from <italic>Treponema denticola</italic> using HDA resulted in a decreasing amount of product as the initial copy number used decreased <xref rid="pone.0112656-Vincent1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, non-specific amplification could be seen in the no-template control, presumably as a result of primer-dimer artifacts. Several of these isothermal methods, such as RPA, use complex target-specific probes in an attempt to distinguish between target and non-specific amplification. However, because the assay components are consumed, these non-specific reactions may amplify at rates that are faster than the rate of target DNA amplification, leading to a loss of sensitivity. In SIBA, such problems are absent since it is designed in such a way that only target-specific DNA can be amplified efficiently. SIBA can be used to reliably detect low copy numbers of pathogens, as demonstrated by the detection of low copy numbers of <italic>Salmonella</italic> DNA, and is suitable for both routine centralized as well as decentralized testing since the method can be performed with low-cost instruments. Low cost devices have been developed for fluorescent detection of common isothermal DNA amplification methods such as RPA and LAMP. These can also be used to monitor the SIBA reaction product as well as for assessing reaction product specificity. A microplate reader or fluorometers with temperature control function are also suitable for detecting SIBA reaction products. SIBA reactions can also be performed using an incubator set at 40&#x000b0;C. The reaction product can then be detected by gel electrophoresis if needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112656.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
