In the present study, we examined the impact of this LPC on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in vascular endothelial EA.hy926 cells. Basal NO formation in these cells was decreased by LPC 18:1. This was accompanied with a partial disruption of the active endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)- dimer, leading to eNOS uncoupling and increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The LPC 18:1-induced ROS formation was attenuated by the superoxide scavenger Tiron, as well as by the pharmacological inhibitors of eNOS, NADPH oxidases, flavin-containing enzymes and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Intracellular ROS-formation was most prominent in mitochondria, less pronounced in cytosol and undetectable in endoplasmic reticulum. Importantly, Tiron completely prevented the LPC 18:1-induced decrease in NO bioavailability in EA.hy926 cells. The importance of the discovered findings for more in vivo like situations was analyzed by organ bath experiments in mouse aortic rings. LPC 18:1 attenuated the acetylcholine-induced, endothelium dependent vasorelaxation and massively decreased NO bioavailability. We conclude that LPC 18:1 induces eNOS uncoupling and unspecific superoxide production. This results in NO scavenging by ROS, a limited endothelial NO bioavailability and impaired vascular function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Medical University of Graz (Ph.D. Program &#x0201c;Molecular Medicine&#x0201d;), by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB815, TP1 to K.Schr.), Alexander von Humbolt fellowship to M.S.K.W., The Austrian Science Fund FWF (Grant P22553-B18 to R.M.) and Lanyar Foundation Grants 369 and 386 (S.F.).

Considering the established impact of oxidative burden on eNOS <xref rid="pone.0113443-Forstermann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the disruption of eNOS dimer and eNOS uncoupling result in an increased ROS formation. It remains to be determined whether oxidation of the critical eNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, or local depletion of eNOS substrate L-arginine per se or via acute induction of arginases caused eNOS uncoupling in cells exposed to LPC 18:1 <xref rid="pone.0113443-Forstermann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although accumulation of an endogenous eNOS inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) was observed in endothelial cells exposed to LPC 16:0 for 24 h <xref rid="pone.0113443-Jia1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, it is unlikely that in our experimental model a 15 min- exposure of cells to LPC 18:1 is sufficient to allow accumulation of ADMA. Recently we found that a short incubation with LPC results in a significantly increased LPC levels in endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0113443-Riederer3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This is in line with a very rapid incorporation of LPC into the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0113443-Croset1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113443-Riederer3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113443-Bhamidipati1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113443-Stoll1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Accordingly, it is tempting to speculate that LPC 18:1 taken up by cells interacts directly with eNOS thus changing structural integrity and functionality of the enzyme. Additionally, LPC may by incorporation into the cell membrane change the bilayer thickness and leaflet curvature balance <xref rid="pone.0113443-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> or change the composition and stability of caveolae leading to altered interaction of eNOS with caveolin-1 or heat shock protein 90, both involved in modulation of eNOS integrity and activity <xref rid="pone.0113443-GarciaCardena1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The observed weak and non-significant decrease in eNOS activity could not explain a profound decrease in NO bioavailability, strongly arguing for the role of LPC 18:1 induced ROS in NO degradation.</p><p>A consequence of eNOS uncoupling is an increased and uncontrolled ROS formation. In the present study a short exposure of cells to LPC 18:1 significantly increased intracellular and extracellular ROS levels, mediated by various enzymes from different subcellular compartments. From ROS measurements in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of ROS-producing enzymes and from fluorescent microscopy data, it appears that NADPH oxidases, uncoupled eNOS and additional flavoprotein-containing enzymes in cytosol and mitochondria are major sources of ROS in LPC 18:1-treated cells. A strong ROS signal in mitochondria of LPC 18:1-treated cells is consistent with a previous report showing LPC 16:0-mediated induction of mitochondrial ROS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0113443-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Several previous studies demonstrated ROS induction in cells exposed to LPC 16:0, with the argumentation based on the inhibitory effects of DPI, for the role of NADPH oxidases in ROS generation <xref rid="pone.0113443-Ojala1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113443-Jia1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113443-Inoue1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113443-Takeshita1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Considering the inhibitory effect of DPI on many different flavoprotein-containing enzymes it is likely that many different enzymes in addition to NADPH oxidase, including those in mitochondria as well as uncoupled eNOS, like in our study, contributed to LPC induced ROS formation in those studies. However, the exact intracellular localization and the relative quantitative as well as temporal contributions of the various ROS sources in LPC 18:1-treated cells require further investigation.</p><p>In addition to increased intracellular ROS we observed increased superoxide levels in cell media of LPC 18:1-treated cells. Because the plasma membrane is poorly permeable for superoxide anions their increase in extracellular compartment most likely reflects contribution of plasma membrane localized uncoupled eNOS. The uncoupling of eNOS results in an enhanced ROS-formation by eNOS itself, which in turn may trigger ROS production by a variety of sources <xref rid="pone.0113443-Ray1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. The augmented production of superoxide anions further limits NO bioavailability by the formation of peroxynitrite. As a consequence, vasorelaxation is strongly impaired in the presence of LPC 18:1. Because serum interferes with myography measurements due to extensive foam formation and because 60 &#x000b5;M LPC 18:1 would under serum-free conditions be detrimental to aortic rings, the impact of LPC 18:1 on vascular function was studied in aortic rings exposed to 10 &#x000b5;M LPC 18:1 in the absence of serum for 15 min. Such free LPC might appear in vivo during excessive lipolysis when albumin and other carrier plasma proteins are saturated with FA and LPC <xref rid="pone.0113443-Croset1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We found previously that 10 &#x000b5;M LPC 18:1 when applied in the absence of serum is not toxic to cultured endothelial cells or aortic rings <xref rid="pone.0113443-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113443-Riederer1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the present study we show that 10 &#x000b5;M LPC 18:1 applied in the absence of serum impacts NO bioavailability and ROS production similarly to 60 &#x000b5;M LPC applied with 5% FBS.</p><p>Since increased oxidative burden is the major player responsible for the attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxation in aged vessels and in various pathologies (essential hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis) <xref rid="pone.0113443-Vanhoutte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> the augmentation of ROS with concomitantly decreased NO in vascular endothelium exposed to LPC 18:1 strongly argues for the conceivable contribution of this LPC to endothelial dysfunction in aging and aforementioned pathologies. The relevance of our data obtained in cell culture and aortic rings for human cardiovascular pathophysiology is highlighted by a most recent report on increased LPC 18:1 plasma levels in prehypertensive patients compared with normotensive controls <xref rid="pone.0113443-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the results of the present study we conclude that eNOS uncoupling and augmented ROS production with concomitant NO scavenging cause the reduction of NO bioavailability in endothelial cells and mouse aortic rings exposed to LPC 18:1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113443.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>LPC 18:1 has no effect on cell viability.
