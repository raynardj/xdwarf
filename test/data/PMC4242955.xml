mobilization and self-stretching exercise on the pulmonary functions of patients with
chronic neck pain. [Subjects] The present study was performed with 34 patients with
chronic neck pain featuring thoracic kyphosis; we divided them into a thoracic joint
mobilization group (TJMG, n = 11), self-stretching exercise group (SSEG, n = 11), and
thoracic joint mobilization and self-stretching exercise group (TJMSSEG, n = 12).
[Methods] Treatments and exercise were conducted three times a week for six weeks in TJMG,
SSEG, and TJMSSEG; the subjects&#x02019; pulmonary functions in terms of forced vital capacity
(FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were
measured using CardioTouch equipment. [Results] Comparisons of the individuals within each
of the TJMG, SSEG, and TJMSSEG showed that all of FVC, FEV1, and PEF increased
significantly; Comparisons within each of the showed that FVC, FEV1, and PEF increased
significantly. Among the study groups, FVC was significantly higher in TJMSSEG than in
TJMG after six weeks; FEV1 was significantly higher in TJMSSEG than in TJMG and SSEG after
four and six weeks; and PEF was significantly higher in TJMSSEG than in TJMG and SSEG
after six weeks. [Conclusion] The study results indicate that thoracic joint mobilization
and self-stretching exercise are effective interventions for increasing FVC, FEV1, and PEF
among pulmonary functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Thoracic joint mobilization</kwd><kwd>Self-stretching exercise</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In modern society, as more people are sitting for longer periods and aging progresses,
kyphosis in the thoracic vertebra has been increasing<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; this results in rounded shoulders and a decrease in thoracic cavity
and vital lung capacity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
this slouched posture puts the upper and lower cervical spine into a relative tension state
while forwardly inclining the lower part of the cervical spine<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A sustained forward-bending posture in the cervical spine could
increase the load around the tissues near the neck<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as the activities of muscles near the neck; additionally,
the load increase in the assistant muscles and joints becomes a main cause of chronic pain
near the neck and shoulder areas<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have sought to determine various causes of chronic neck pain, and to present
therapeutic approaches from various aspects; the results of studies on what constitutes the
best therapeutic approach to chronic neck pain, however, have been divergent<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the studies, one study reported that
abnormal movement of the thoracic vertebra is a fundamental cause of cervical disorder in
terms of the biomechanical correlation between the cervical spine and thoracic vertebra<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that not only direct
joint mobilization of the cervical spine but also improvement of movement in the upper
thoracic vertebra can increase the range of motion and reduce pain in the cervical
spine<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most effective joint
exercise therapy for increasing mobility in the thoracic vertebra is thoracic joint
mobilization, which extends the joint in a direction in which movement is restrained<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A self-stretching exercise can not only
increase the flexibility of muscles in the joints but can also reduce muscle tension and
increase blood circulation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although many previous studies have sought to determine the effect of thoracic joint
mobilization and self-stretching exercise on pain and range of joint motion, previous
studies have not addressed their effects on pulmonary functions. The aim of the current
study was to determine the effect of such treatment and exercise on the pulmonary functions
of patients with chronic neck pain and thoracic kyphosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 34 patients with chronic neck pain during spinal flexion
who visited Hospital N located in Daegu Metropolitan City, South Korea. Age, height, and
weight in the TJM group (TJMG; 7 males and 4 females) were on average, 55.6&#x000b1;1.1&#x02005;years,
164.5&#x000b1;2.6&#x02005;cm, and 63.6&#x000b1;3.5&#x02005;kg. In the SSE group (SSEG; 5 males and 6 females), they were
53.0&#x000b1;0.8&#x02005;years, 166.8&#x000b1;2.8&#x02005;cm, and 166.8&#x000b1;2.8&#x02005;kg. Finally, in the TJMSSE group (TJMSSEG; 5
males and 7 females), they were 54.4&#x000b1;0.6&#x02005;years, 167.3&#x000b1;2.3&#x02005;cm, 65.0&#x000b1;3.5&#x02005;kg. The subjects were
randomly and equally assigned to the three groups. Prior to the experiment, all the subjects
listened to an explanation of the study&#x02019;s purpose and exercise methods and provided written
consent. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Youngdong University
institutional review board. Those who had been diagnosed with neurological findings and
undergone operations or who were receiving surgical treatment or taking medicines on a
regular basis to relieve pain were excluded from the study. We selected those with a spinal
angle of 45 degrees or higher when measured in a standing position using a spinal mouse and
a &#x0201c;minor disability&#x0201d; with a neck disability index ranging from 5 to 14 points.</p><p>During a six-week period, the subjects were treated three times a week. TJMG performed TJM
for 15&#x02005;min, SSEG performed SSEs for 15&#x02005;min, and TJMSSEG conducted TJM for 15&#x02005;min and SSEs
for 15&#x02005;min. All three groups also received conservative physical therapy. TJMG first
performed thoracic flexion mobilization. Each subject was instructed to sit on a therapeutic
chair, cross his/her arms, and place them in the transverse in the jointed part of the
cervical vertebrae behind the neck.</p><p>The therapist stood to the left of the subject and fixed his/her vertebrae to the spinal
segments intended to be treated. Using his/her hands, the therapist then adjusted the back
support of the therapeutic chair or a wedge placed between the subjects and chair (Original
Kaltenborn Concept Wedge, Allgummi GmbH &#x00026; Co, Germany). The therapist then wrapped the
subject&#x02019;s crossed elbows with his/her hands and flexed the subject&#x02019;s trunk slowly while
pressing both elbows in the rear lower direction of the back support. During this process,
the therapist used his/her hand to check the amount of spinal movement and potential
movement of the vertebrae. Next, thoracic extension mobilization was performed. The
therapist and the subject maintained the same posture as that of thoracic flexion
mobilization. After wrapping the subject&#x02019;s crossed elbows with a hand, the therapist slowly
stretched the subject&#x02019;s trunk backward by pressing both elbows in the rear upper direction
of the back support. Finally, the separation technique of thoracic facet joint distraction
mobilization was then employed. The subject lay face down on a treatment table. The
therapist then selected the segments with less movement among the spinal auricular surfaces
using a wedge and placed across the wedge crossways the selected vertebrae. The therapist
grabbed the wedge with both hands and exerted a force for joint traction using his/her
weight.</p><p>SSEG conducted SSEs on the major and minor pectorals. First, the subject sat on a chair
with his/her back straightened and pulled in his/her jaw. The subject held a long belt with
both hands and spread it wider than the distance between the shoulders. While bending the
shoulders at 180&#x000b0;, the subject flexed the shoulders excessively, as if stretching. After
maintaining this position for 10 sec, the subject returned to the original position. Next,
SSEs of the upper trapezius were performed. While seated with a correct posture on the
chair, the subject fixed the hand intended to be extended behind a sheet placed under the
hip to depress the shoulder. After this, the subject adopted a cervical posture (flexion +
side flexion + rotation; non-coupled motion) to extend the upper trapezius to the fullest
and maintained this posture for 45 sec. Finally, the SSE was performed on the levator
scapulae of the shoulder bone. In this exercise, the subject adopted the correct sitting
posture on a chair and depressed the shoulders by fixing the hand intended to be extended
behind the sheet under the hip. The subject then adopted a posture (flexion + side flexion +
rotation couple motion) to extend the levator scapulae to the fullest and maintained it for
45 sec.</p><p>To measure pulmonary functions, a CardioTouch 3000s (Bionet; Seoul, South Korea) was used
while the subjects remained seated. The forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory
volume at one second (FEV1) were measured, while the peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured
to determine airway resistance. To reduce measurement error, in each case, the average of
three measurements was used as the final result.</p><p>Repeated one-way ANOVA was employed for statistical processing to determine the pulmonary
function within each group; one-way ANOVA, meanwhile, was conducted to compare the groups
themselves. The Bonferroni correction method was used as a post hoc test. The current study
used SPSS 12.0 for Windows for statistical processing, and the significance level &#x003b1; was set
to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparisons within each of the groups showed that FVC, FEV1, and PEF increased
significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Among the study groups, FVC was significantly higher in TJMSSEG
than in TJMG after six weeks; FEV1 was significantly higher in TJMSSEG than in TJMG and SSEG
after four and six weeks (p &#x0003c; 0.05); and PEF was significantly higher in TJMSSEG than in
TJMG and SSEG after six weeks (p &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

of TJM and SSEs on pulmonary function in patients with chronic neck pain. Jeong<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the ROM in the jointed part
of the neck and spine and chronic neck pain show a high correlation. In other words, if the
ROM in the jointed part of the neck and spine increases, the VAS and neck disability index
also increase in patients with chronic neck pain. Cleland et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that manipulation of the upper vertebrae (C7 to
T2) and middle vertebrae (T3 to T10) exercises resulted in a statistically significant
decline in chronic neck pain. Sterling et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the VAS declined from 5.8&#x02005;cm to 2.8&#x02005;cm after applying
the joint mobilization technique. Hurwitz et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that a three-week program of electrical therapy and joint
mobilization was more effective than joint exercise in patients with subacute neck pain. Kim
et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the range of motion
of the upper spine was an effective intervention for dynamic stability among chronic neck
pain patients</p><p>In active exercise therapies, extension is effective in increasing the ROM in soft tissues
and the ROM in reduced narrow ROM structures<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jung<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that an eight-week home-based cervical exercise program changes the curves in the right
side. Omer et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> also asserted that
mobilization and stretching relaxation techniques are effective for reducing and increasing
the ROM of computer users who exhibit cervical and trapezius pain. Yang<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that application of thoracic vertebra extension
exercises resulted in statistically significant increases in VAS, spinal length (C7 to S3),
and flexibility of thoracic vertebra extension. Seo<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> found that male office workers who complained of cervical pain
experienced a minor level of improvement after application of upper thoracic vertebra
exercises, but this result was not statistically significant.</p><p>As mentioned, comparisons of the individuals within TJMG, SSEG, and TJMSSEG showed that
FVC, FEV1, and PEF had increased significantly; Among the study groups, FVC was
significantly higher in TJMSSEG than in TJMG after six weeks; FEV1 was significantly higher
in TJMSSEG than in TJMG and SSEG after four and six weeks; and PEF was significantly higher
in the TJMSSEG than in the TJMG and SSEG, after six weeks. Chronic neck pain patients with
thoracic kyphosis develop round shoulders that stem from increased thoracic kyphosis; this
triggers decreases in vital capacity and thoracic cavity capacity. This is because thoracic
joint mobilization or self-stretching exercises for the spine improve limited movements of
the spine, recover facet joint sliding, and normalize the articular capsule, thereby
decreasing kyphosis and enhancing the flexibility of thoracic extension. Therefore, it is
considered that increased mobility of the thorax ameliorates pulmonary functions. In
addition, pulmonary functions were better in TJMSSEG than in TJMG and SSEG after six weeks
because the simultaneous performance of thoracic joint mobilization (a therapist&#x02019;s passive
manual therapy) and self-stretching exercise (performed by patients themselves) was
effective in recovering facet joint sliding of the spine and normalizing the articular
capsule.</p><p>This study had some limitations. The main one is the limited number of subjects with
chronic neck pain, resulting in difficulties generalizing the results. Furthermore, this
study failed to measure range of motion of thoracic kyphosis and the flexibility of spinal
extension. Future studies will be required to identify the effects of TJM and SSEs on the
pulmonary functions of patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Neumann</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group>: Kinesiology of the Musculoskeletal System: Foundations for
