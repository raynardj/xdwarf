To accurately detect and characterize breast lesions using MRI, in particular for dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) studies <xref rid="pone.0113969-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, high temporal resolution is required in addition to high spatial resolution <xref rid="pone.0113969-Nnewihe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113969-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. At standard clinical fields (3T and below), however, the practicality of simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution is limited by the achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) <xref rid="pone.0113969-Korteweg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113969-Kraff1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In order to explore the potential of recently available commercial high field scanners to address this limitation, several groups are investigating breast imaging and spectroscopy at 7T <xref rid="pone.0113969-Korteweg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113969-Vaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113969-Stehouwer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The increase in sensitivity provided by high fields can be exploited to increase spatial and/or temporal resolution. In addition, it has been shown that further temporal acceleration can be achieved at high fields from enhanced SENSE performance due to the decrease in coil sensitivity degeneracy <xref rid="pone.0113969-Wiesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Despite these advantages, translation of high field MRI to standard clinical usage for breast (or any other) studies has not been straightforward, primarily due to the increased Larmor frequency of hydrogen and the associated wavelength effects that confound homogeneity and power deposition <xref rid="pone.0113969-Vaughan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113969-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113969-VandeMoortele1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, much of the work in breast imaging has focused on optimizing the RF coil design <xref rid="pone.0113969-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113969-Umutlu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Unilateral and bilateral breast receive-only and transmit/receive array coils with up to 30 elements have been presented, working in concert with a variety of transmit coil designs <xref rid="pone.0113969-Italiaander1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113969-vandeBank1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We have previously reported the advantages of transmitting with &#x0201c;forced current excitation&#x0201d; (FCE) in the design of a highly homogenous quadrature volume breast coil for 7T <xref rid="pone.0113969-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This uniform B<sub>1</sub> excitation provides predictable imaging contrast and consistent fat suppression. In this work we describe a unilateral 16-channel receive array insert designed for use in the FCE transmit volume coil being driven for optimized quadrature operation with dual-transmit RF shimming. The performance of the new coil was evaluated based on its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) advantage over the volume coil and its ability to enable high spatial and high temporal resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> breast images. The improved resolution afforded by this synergistic design is expected to greatly benefit breast lesion detection and characterization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dual Transmit Coil</title><p>All hardware was designed and tested for use on a whole-body 7T scanner configured with two independent transmit channels (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems). The transmit coil was based on a previously-reported unilateral Helmholtz-saddle configuration designed to produce homogenous quadrature excitation of the pendant breast using forced current excitation (FCE) <xref rid="pone.0113969-McDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A rendering of the volume coil with the array in place is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>. In this design, a Helmholtz pair and a saddle pair are orthogonal to each other, and the two elements of each pair are connected to a common voltage point (CVP) with quarter wavelengths of transmission line. This forces equal currents to be delivered to the top and bottom loops of the Helmholtz pair, as well as to the left and right elements in the saddle pair. Each pair was separately driven by one of the independent transmit channels. As previously reported, the resulting transmit field was highly homogenous, despite the asymmetric loading in the anterior-posterior direction presented by the thorax when imaging the pendant breast and, more significantly, in the presence of the asymmetric loading presented by the hemispherical array insert. The Helmholtz loops had an inner diameter of 160 mm and were separated by 80 mm, and the saddle elements were constructed on a cylindrical tube with an inner diameter of 153 mm and centered inside of the Helmholtz pair. The saddle elements each were segmented by twelve breaks with 13 pF capacitors (1111C series, Passive Plus) and the Helmholtz elements each with twenty breaks, alternating between 10 and 12 pF capacitors (1111C series, Passive Plus) after the breaks for the feed points. All four transmit elements had individual co-planar shields.</p><fig id="pone-0113969-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113969.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of transmit and receive coil setup.</title><p>A) Rendering of transmit coil (in orange, i.d.&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;153 mm, depth&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;110 mm) with 16-channel receive array insert (in blue), and B) Schematic overview of FCE detuning circuitry utilizing &#x003bb;/4 transmission lines to open-circuit each transmit coil element when diodes at the common voltage point (CVP) are biased.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0113969.g001"/></fig><p>The FCE configuration also enabled straightforward detuning of the transmit coil during receive.

As a potential advantage, this approach creates physical separation between the DC control lines and the field-of-view.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Receive Array</title><p>A dedicated 16-channel receive array was designed for insertion in the open-sided FCE dual transmit volume coil. The array was constructed on a polycarbonate hemispherical shell fabricated with a fusion deposition modeling (FDM) rapid prototyping machine. The shell had an inner diameter of 142 mm and a thickness of 3 mm, providing a usable volume of approximately 750 mL, such that the geometrical filling factor would be 52%, 64%, 79%, and 95% of the array volume for average breast sizes 36A, B, C, and D, respectively <xref rid="pone.0113969-McGhee1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This ensures usability of the array on a large portion of the patient population, while keeping the geometrical filling factor at more than 50% in most cases. As pointed out by other authors <xref rid="pone.0113969-Nnewihe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, in custom-designed close-fitting coils, as compared to the commercially available open-form biopsy breast coils, the proximity to the sample is one of the major contributors to improvements in the achievable SNR.</p><p>Element size and placement on the shell were determined by arranging pentagonal and hexagonal tiles in the &#x0201c;soccer ball geometry&#x0201d; presented by Wiggins et al. <xref rid="pone.0113969-Wiggins1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The resulting layout consisted of ten coils with an inner diameter of 70 mm and six coils with an inner diameter of 59 mm in an overlapping coil arrangement over three rows in the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. Roughly speaking there were four independent coils elements in either the left-to-right (L/R) or the foot-to-head (F/H) direction.</p><fig id="pone-0113969-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113969.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>16-channel unilateral breast receive array.</title><p>A) Layout of overlapped receive elements (as observed from the bottom of the hemisphere), highlighting each element's position and size (70 mm loops in blue, 59 mm loops in gray).

Each loop was etched as a &#x0201c;C&#x0201d;-shape with an opening that, when pulled together, resulted in a loop conformed to the surface of the hemispherical shell. Each element had six breaks. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, fixed capacitors (9.1 pF and 11 pF, 1111C series, Passive Plus) were placed across four breaks, and a variable tuning capacitor (46MN series, Passive Plus) was placed across the break opposite the feed. Crossed diodes (UM9989B, Microsemi) and a variable inductor (164 series, Coilcraft) in parallel with the tuning capacitor formed a passive trap to increase isolation of each element during transmit <xref rid="pone.0113969-Sodickson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Given the limited clearance and fit inside the transmit coil, the required circuitry at the element feed points was located on detachable circuit boards and connected after inserting the array in the transmit volume coil. These boards contained the active trap configuration (described further below), a balun, and a half-wavelength coaxial cable (including the electrical length of the balun) that connected to the Philips 16-channel receiver interface box, which housed the isolating preamplifiers and bias control. An SMA plug connected to the feed point of the element allowed for direct connection to an end-launch SMA receptacle on the detachable board. A labeled photograph of one of the 16 boards is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>. The balun was constructed from a user-tunable prefabricated inductor can (3T-CC-3T, Correct Coil). The active trap consisted of a PIN diode (MA4P7470F-1072, M/A-COM), a variable inductor (164 series, Coilcraft), and a fixed match capacitor (13&#x02013;33 pF, 1111C series, Passive Plus). Since the external board included the match capacitor, disconnecting the board from the loop open-circuited the corresponding receive element; thus, removing all but one board created an isolated setting for tuning a single element. Once an individual element was matched and tuned to 50 &#x003a9;, a capacitor was removed from the coil in order to tune the active trap on a non-resonant structure. With the diode forward biased with an external 100 mA source, an inductor probe was used to detect the resonant frequency of the trap and the variable inductor was adjusted until the trap was tuned to 298 MHz. The isolation provided by the trap for each coil element was measured as the change in the S<sub>12</sub> measurement between two decoupled, shielded probes when the PIN diode was unbiased and biased. Isolation was greater than 20 dB in all cases. The 16 cables were bundled in groups and cable traps were created for each bundle to control any remaining induced currents on the cable shields. The cable bundles could be easily routed through alternative paths in the space under the coil platform and this allowed for either left or right side breast imaging.

The phantom was constructed as a hemispheric shell to maximally fill the 750 mL array volume. The phantom was filled with canola oil to mimic the lipid properties of the breast <xref rid="pone.0113969-Bolan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. SNR was evaluated using data acquired from two scans with identical imaging parameters, with the RF and gradient amplifiers turned on in one scan and off in the other to generate a noise-only scan <xref rid="pone.0113969-Kellman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Imaging for the purpose of evaluating SNR was performed using typical parameters for the widely used clinical sequence of sagittal 3D T1-weighted fast gradient echo multishot pulse sequence (THRIVE). While the clinical THRIVE sequence uses fat suppression, phantom SNR imaging was performed with the fat saturation turned off since the phantom was entirely composed of canola oil. The following scan parameters were used: TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.0 ms, TE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.77 ms, flip angle&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8&#x000b0;, resolution of 1&#x000d7;1&#x000d7;2 mm<sup>3</sup> (4 mm-thick overcontiguous slices), bandwidth of 1056 Hz/pixel, acquisition matrix 160&#x000d7;160.</p><p>In addition, we have previously reported marked improvements in homogeneity when sample-specific dual-transmit optimization was used in order to achieve circular polarization <xref rid="pone.0113969-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113969-Cheshkov2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Specifically, regions of low signal intensity and decreased SNR were observed if the relative excitation phase between the Helmholtz and the saddle pairs was not optimized for that particular sample. Given the variability in size and composition of the human breast, we expect this per-subject optimization of the quadrature field to play an important role in achieving optimum image quality. Therefore, the Helmholtz pair and the saddle pair were driven in parallel by two independent 4 kW RF amplifiers. The procedure used to calibrate the channels was described previously <xref rid="pone.0113969-Cheshkov2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and it was applied for each individual phantom scan and on a per-volunteer basis. Briefly, B<sub>1</sub> calibration maps were collected, per individual transmit channel, using a dual-TR 3D B<sub>1</sub> acquisition <xref rid="pone.0113969-Yarnykh1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> with nominal flip angle of 50&#x000b0;, TR1/TR2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;35/140 ms, and resolution 2&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;10 mm<sup>3</sup>. Both magnitude and phase data were acquired and used to set the relative transmit channel amplitude and phase to achieve true circular polarization over a user-selected region in the middle slice of the 3D field maps. Volume selective power optimization <xref rid="pone.0113969-Versluis1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> was also used in the same region to achieve final 90&#x000b0; calibration. CLEAR (constant level of appearance) homogeneity correction was turned off and SENSE was set to one (i.e. no acceleration). The SNR map was calculated by dividing, on a pixel-per-pixel basis, the signal from the phantom image by the standard deviation of a 30 mm&#x000d7;30 mm area at the same location in the noise-only scan <xref rid="pone.0113969-vandeBank1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. As is customary, the noise-only scans from the individual 16 elements were also used to generate a noise correlation matrix for the array. Geometry factor (<italic>g</italic>-factor) maps were obtained with the same imaging protocol, adding SENSE acceleration factors of 1&#x000d7;, 2&#x000d7;, or 3&#x000d7; in the foot-to-head (F/H) direction combined with acceleration of 1&#x000d7;, 2&#x000d7;, or 3&#x000d7; in the left-to-right (L/R) direction. The <italic>g</italic>-factor maps were calculated using the manufacturer's on-the-scanner reconstruction algorithm.

The subjects were in prone position with the head resting on pillows and with arms either to the side or above the head. An <italic>in vivo</italic> comparison of the SNR of the 16-channel receive insert versus the standalone FCE volume T/R coil was performed using a 3D T1-weighted THRIVE sequence similar to the one used in the phantom study. Total scan time was 1&#x02236;32 minutes. To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> SENSE performance of the coil as quantified by <italic>g</italic>-factor mapping, images were also obtained with and without various accelerations up to 9&#x000d7; (1&#x000d7;, 2&#x000d7;, 3&#x000d7; in the L/R and F/H directions) with the 16-channel receive array insert.</p><p>Fat suppressed 3D T1-weighted sagittal breast imaging was performed by fixing the total acquisition time at the clinically relevant 90 s and two different spatial resolutions were obtained: (i) 1-mm isotropic resolution, which is commonly used clinically, and (ii) high resolution 0.5-mm isotropic images (i.e. an 8-fold volumetric reduction as compared to the clinically-used protocol), with SENSE acceleration factors of 2.2 in the F/H direction and 2.1 in the L/R directions. The dual-transmit settings of the coil were calibrated per individual patient, as described in the phantom imaging section.</p><p>The 1-mm resolution images obtained for the spatial resolution comparison were then obtained with 3-fold acceleration in both L/R and F/H directions, reducing acquisition time from 90 to 7 s. This constituted a 13-fold temporal acceleration as compared to the standard clinical dynamic resolution. Other relevant acquisition parameters, used in both the spatial and temporal comparison studies, were as follows: TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4 ms, TE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2 ms, flip angle&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8&#x000b0;, FOV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;160&#x000d7;160&#x000d7;160 mm, SPAIR TI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;150 ms.</p><p>Lastly, high spatial and temporal resolution images were acquired in a patient diagnosed with a fibroadenoma (up to 3.5 cm in size, located 3 cm from the nipple) in the right breast. Images were acquired using a 0.6-mm isotropic THRIVE (i.e. 5-fold volumetric reduction as compared to the 1-mm clinical protocol), with bidirectional SENSE of 2&#x000d7;2 [(F/H)&#x000d7;(L/R), in a total acquisition time of 60 s (i.e. 1.5-fold temporal acceleration)].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>SNR</title><p>One of the primary motivations for using ultra-high field imaging is the inherent increase in detection sensitivity. To illustrate the gains in sensitivity achieved with the array coil, SNR maps of the homogenous phantom are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, acquired with the standalone FCE volume coil with the array removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and with the 16-channel receive array coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The array improved SNR throughout the entire phantom, achieving a mean SNR improvement of 3.3 times with up to a 10.8 times increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113969-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) at the edges. As expected, the array sensitivity steadily decreased with distance into the phantom <xref rid="pone.0113969-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and a 2.1 times increase in SNR was achieved in a region of interest in the center of the phantom towards what would be the chest wall. While the homogeneity of the FCE transmit coil was unaffected by the presence of the array, there were other practical effects due to the addition of the conducting elements and components. As would be expected, the addition of the array required the transmit coil to be re-tuned, though not out of the range of the variable capacitor. In addition, based on the Philips' driving scales, a 22% increase in power was required to achieve a 90-degree flip angle.</p><fig id="pone-0113969-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113969.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of SNR maps in a phantom between the 16-channel receive array and volume coil.</title><p>Improvements in SNR when using close-fitting 16-channel array.

By using the array insert, a mean SNR improvement of 3.3 times was achieved in phantom imaging as compared to the closely-fitting volume coil in T/R mode. Unique properties of the FCE coil allowed the insert to be added with minimal modification to the transmit coil for detuning. In addition, the combined breast coil design benefits from the uniform B<sub>1</sub> field produced by the FCE transmit coil, while the two independent transmit channels allowed for adjusting of the excitation to &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; quadrature mode for increased efficiency. Clinically, the SNR improvement provided by the receive array enabled the ability to perform bidirectional acceleration up to R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9 without significant penalty, allowing for shorter acquisition times and improved spatial resolution. The high SENSE acceleration factors achieved demonstrated once again the synergy between high static field and parallel imaging, based on the advantage of the more inhomogeneous receive patterns exhibited at high fields <xref rid="pone.0113969-Wiesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The results clearly demonstrate the promise of coil design and optimization to enable effective MR imaging of the breast at 7T.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113969-Kriege1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
