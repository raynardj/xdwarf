<italic>Rationale</italic>
</title><p>Humans with a dominant negative mutation in STAT3 are susceptible to severe skin infections, suggesting an essential role for STAT3 signaling in defense against cutaneous pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Methods</italic>
</title><p>To focus on innate antiviral defenses in keratinocytes, we used a standard model of cutaneous infection of severe combined immunodeficient mice with the current smallpox vaccine, ACAM-2000. In parallel, early events post-infection with the smallpox vaccine ACAM-2000 were investigated in cultured keratinocytes of human and mouse origin.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Results</italic>
</title><p>Mice treated topically with a STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic) developed larger vaccinia lesions with higher virus titers and died more rapidly than untreated controls. Cultured human and murine keratinocytes infected with ACAM-2000 underwent rapid necrosis, but when treated with Stattic or with inhibitors of RIP1 kinase or caspase-1, they survived longer, produced higher titers of virus, and showed reduced activation of type I interferon responses and inflammatory cytokines release. Treatment with inhibitors of RIP1 kinase and STAT3, but not caspase-1, also reduced the inflammatory response of keratinocytes to TLR ligands. Vaccinia growth properties in Vero cells, which are known to be defective in some antiviral responses, were unaffected by inhibition of RIP1K, caspase-1, or STAT3.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Conclusions</italic>
</title><p>Our findings indicate that keratinocytes suppress the replication and spread of vaccinia virus by undergoing rapid programmed cell death, in a process requiring STAT3. These data offer a new framework for understanding susceptibility to skin infection in patients with STAT3 mutations. Interventions which promote prompt necroptosis/pyroptosis of infected keratinocytes may reduce risks associated with vaccination with live vaccinia virus.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Medical Countermeasures Initiative and Modernization of Science funding awarded by the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Although research on vaccination complications has traditionally focused on defects in humoral or cell-mediated immunity, there is increasing evidence that innate or acquired abnormalities of keratinocyte function may also result in uncontrolled virus spread. The failure of keratinocytes to provide an effective antiviral barrier appears to underlie the extensive infections which may occur when persons with skin disorders ranging from atopic dermatitis to burns and acne are vaccinated against smallpox <xref rid="pone.0113690-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>One innate defect which was not known in the era of universal smallpox vaccination is the dominant negative mutation in the <italic>STAT3</italic> gene responsible for hyper-IgE (&#x0201c;Job's&#x0201d;) syndrome, which is characterized by a chronic eczema-like skin condition and enhanced susceptibility to cutaneous bacterial and viral infections, observed from days after birth and continuing throughout life <xref rid="pone.0113690-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. There are no specific accounts of smallpox vaccine complications in hyper-IgE syndrome patients, but it seems likely that, as in naturally occurring herpesvirus and varicella infections, a defect in STAT3 signaling would permit extensive spread of vaccinia virus <xref rid="pone.0113690-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113690-Olaiwan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Defining a protective role of STAT3 in the response to infection might therefore lead to the development of novel countermeasures against vaccinia and other pathogens.</p><p>In the present study, we examine the role of STAT3 signaling in the response to smallpox vaccination, and show for the first time that it plays an essential role in the rapid programmed necrosis of keratinocytes induced by vaccinia virus. To focus on innate antiviral defenses, we inoculated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with ACAM-2000, the current licensed smallpox vaccine, and applied Stattic, a small-molecule inhibitor of both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated STAT3 SH2 domains <xref rid="pone.0113690-Schust1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, to the vaccination site. In parallel studies, we measured viral replication, cell viability and inflammatory responses in ACAM-2000-infected human and mouse keratinocytes. We observed the effects of STAT3 inhibition via siRNA or Stattic, and the impact of blocking RIP1 kinase, an essential element in necroptosis, or caspase-1, which is required for pyroptosis <xref rid="pone.0113690-Kaczmarek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113690-Bergsbaken1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our data suggest that vaccinia rapidly triggers both necrosome and inflammasome activation in keratinocytes, resulting in marked suppression of viral replication and cell death, but these responses fail to occur in the absence of STAT3. Vero cells, which are known to be defective in some antiviral responses <xref rid="pone.0113690-Emeny1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, permitted greater viral replication that was unaffected by the three inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells, chemicals and reagents</title><p>HEK001 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Defined Keratinocyte Serum Free Medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5 ng/ml recombinant EGF (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO).

Our results provide new insights into the complexity of multi-layered resistance against skin pathogens. Effective defense appears to require a combination of innate responses of keratinocytes, to restrict pathogen replication and alert the immune system, in addition to adaptive immune responses, to limit pathogen dissemination and kill infected cells. Our data suggest that rapid necrosis of infected cells eliminates an essential niche for virus replication, and establishes an antiviral firewall in part through paracrine NF&#x003ba;B, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b2; signals. Since the host response of programmed necrosis has evolved through natural selection, it possibly also enhances protective adaptive immune responses to virus infection, in ways that have not yet been fully elucidated. Together these observations highlight for the first time host-protective roles for keratinocyte programmed necrosis, which in previous studies had only been linked with pathogenic cutaneous inflammation <xref rid="pone.0113690-Bonnet1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Rapid programmed cell death in response to vaccinia virus was earlier demonstrated by Cho and colleagues, who inoculated mice intraperitoneally with the virulent WR strain <xref rid="pone.0113690-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In their study, RIP3 deficient mice infected with VACV-WR via intraperitoneal route had increased virus titers, greater mortality, and reduced inflammation compared with similarly infected wild type mice. The authors concluded that damage-associated molecular patterns released from sites of necroptosis help to control the spread of infection by eliciting a strong inflammatory response. Our data confirm and extend these observations, demonstrating for the first time that keratinocytes targeted by the vaccine strain ACAM-2000 undergo rapid cell death dependent on both caspase-1 (pyroptosis) and RIP1K (necroptosis). Blocking either of these early cell death responses increased vaccinia replication in vitro, highlighting contributions of both pathways in limiting viral replication. The current data additionally point to RIP1K-dependent signaling pathways, but not caspase-1, as critical activators of NF&#x003ba;B and type I interferon in keratinocytes. More work will be required to evaluate the relative roles of receptors such as TNFR, TLRs, and viral nucleic acid sensors (e.g. NALP1, RIG-I, DAI) in triggering RIPK dependent keratinocyte death, and how vaccinia-encoded factors may subvert the necroptotic process, as has been described in cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus <xref rid="pone.0113690-Mack1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Our studies are the first to our knowledge to indicate a host-protective role for STAT3 in virus-infected cells. In normal and in transformed cells, STAT3 promotes transcription of proteins which enhance cell cycle progression and antagonize apoptotic cell death <xref rid="pone.0113690-Timofeeva1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In previous reports, signals from transcriptionally active STAT3 dimers were shown to keep virus-infected cells alive and promote pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0113690-Sen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our work has incorporated several key differences from previous studies. First we focused on keratinocytes, rather than fibroblasts or other cell lines in which innate antiviral responses are either untested or known to be deficient. We also evaluated time points very early after in vitro and in vivo infection, and utilized STAT3 inhibitory approaches that block unphosphorylated and phosphorylated STAT3 <xref rid="pone.0113690-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, not just Tyr-705 activated monomers and dimers. Using this approach, we found rapid necrosis of vaccinia-infected keratinocytes, and cytoplasmic accumulation of STAT3 and TAK1, within a few hours post-infection. These finding prompt a consideration of new mechanisms by which STAT3 might aid detection and elimination of vaccinia in infected keratinocytes. STAT3 may facilitate association of innate signaling complexes involving TAK1, as was previously described for the IL6R gp130 complex <xref rid="pone.0113690-Kojima1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A signaling scaffold function for STAT3 could result in prolonged association of the TAK1:RIP1K complex, which triggers necroptosis in studies of TNF-stimulated fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0113690-Morioka1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Evaluating possible co-association of STAT3 with TAK1 with molecular sensors of infection is a focus of our ongoing studies. Alternatively or in addition, interactions between cytosolic STAT3 and mitochondrial proteins such as Complex I component Grim19 <xref rid="pone.0113690-Shulga1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113690-Boengler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> could be essential for early antiviral functions requiring superoxide generation.

Similar results were reported by Samavati and colleagues, using Stattic and STAT3-directed siRNA approaches in LPS stimulated macrophages <xref rid="pone.0113690-Samavati1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Dampened inflammatory responses to bacterial triggers in the absence of STAT3 signaling could be consistent with the clinical features of Job's syndrome, in which patients may carry large bacterial burdens in the absence of fever, malaise, and other symptoms normally induced by cytokines <xref rid="pone.0113690-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Our future studies will evaluate the possible role of STAT3 in amplifying early responses to cutaneous bacterial infection, and how these innate responses may be linked with appropriate T-helper lymphocyte activation and function. Despite eradication of naturally occurring smallpox, potential use of variola virus as a bioterrorism agent has spurred continued use of the licensed smallpox vaccine (ACAM-2000) among designated first responders and military personnel <xref rid="pone.0113690-Wharton1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. ACAM-2000 elicits poxvirus-directed T lymphocyte responses and neutralizing antibodies in animal models, suggesting vaccination could confer protection against variola <xref rid="pone.0113690-Hatch1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However vaccination in susceptible people is associated with a risk of virus dissemination from the inoculation site. Eczema vaccinatum (EV), a rare but life-threatening complication of smallpox vaccination, features a rapidly progressing rash over a large proportion of the skin surface in a subset of patients with AD/eczema and other skin disorders <xref rid="pone.0113690-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Our current data suggest that immediate responses to vaccinia infection in the skin are probably important in determining susceptibility to severe outcomes like EV. With this in mind, improved future treatments for EV might include approaches which bolster cutaneous antiviral defense. Our future studies will test topical small molecule approaches to accelerate death of vaccinia infected keratinocytes, using a model of inducible keratinocyte specific STAT3 deficiency.</p><p>In summary, our data provide evidence for STAT3-dependent necroptosis and pyroptosis in keratinocytes, contributing to anti-vaccinia defense of the skin. The data may point to novel roles for STAT3 in facilitating rapid responses to cutaneous infection and damage. Understanding STAT3 dependent innate signaling mechanisms may offer new means of identifying individuals susceptible to severe skin infection, and new opportunities for their treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113690.s001"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>
