Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, has a significant role in this process. Natural medicinal products such as Withaferin A (WA) and Celastrol (Cel) have shown anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties that can be attributed to multiple mechanisms including, but not limited to, apoptosis induction due to the inhibition of proteasomal activities. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TNF-&#x003b1; in combination with WA or Cel in vitro in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. TNF-&#x003b1;, when combined with WA or Cel, activated caspase-3 and -9 and downregulated XIAP in a dose-dependent manner, leading to induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The combination also caused accumulation of the proteasomal target protein I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, resulting in inhibition of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B). Taken together, these results suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; could sensitize breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 to WA and Cel, at least in part, through inhibiting the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, leading to XIAP inhibition with subsequent upregulation of caspase-3 and -9 activities. Thus, the anti-cancer activities of TNF-&#x003b1; are enhanced when combined with the natural proteasome inhibitors, WA or Cel.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially supported by the National Cancer Institute grants (1R01CA20009 to QPD) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81101747 to LL).

It has been shown that the inflammatory microenvironment is essential at different stages of tumor development. However, the direct link between inflammation and tumor development is yet to be identified <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Balkwill1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) is one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines and paradoxically can be either a tumor promoter linking inflammation with carcinogenesis or a tumor inhibitor as it induces cancer cell death due to the sustained JNK activation. Thus, it can promote tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration and angiogenesis as well as being able to induce cancer cell death, making it a double-edged sword in cancer therapy. It is therefore important to find out how to selectively trigger the anti-tumor properties of TNF-&#x003b1; while avoiding or inhibiting its tumorigenic properties <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Balkwill1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Cellular responses to TNF-&#x003b1; are mediated to a large degree by a transcription factor called nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

In this study, we show that WA and Cel increased the levels of caspase-3,-9 proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113783-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0113783-Mandal1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.

This study further showed that WA and Cel induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells through inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B and downregulation of the expression of XIAP (mRNA and protein) and cIAP1/2 (mRNA), resulting in increased levels of caspase-3 and -9 proteins.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is a major key player in TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated biological responses <xref rid="pone.0113783-Balkwill1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Balkwill2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Members of the I&#x003ba;B family of proteins inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B signaling by binding to and thus sequestering NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is triggered by phosphorylation and ubiquitination of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, leading to its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, allowing nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0113783-Beg1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Stehlik1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrate that WA and Cel prevent degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling by inhibiting the proteasome, thus abrogating the inhibitory effect of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling on apoptosis.</p><p>We further demonstrate that the combination of TNF-&#x003b1; with WA or Cel enhances their individual anti-cancer properties. It has been reported previously that TNF-&#x003b1; induces apoptosis due to its interactions with cell surface receptors such as TNF-&#x003b1; receptor (TNFR) 1 and 2 (extrinsic pathway), and mitochondrial dysfunction (intrinsic pathway) <xref rid="pone.0113783-Mandal1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Binding of specific ligands to cell surface receptors of the TNFR family initiates the extrinsic pathway, while the disruption of cellular integrity by the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria triggers the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Complex I is formed when TNF-&#x003b1; binds to TNFR-1. This event leads to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, MAPKs and Complex II, ultimately leading to apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0113783-Mandal1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The members of IAP family of genes are downstream effectors of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0113783-Stehlik1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, hence, the balance between Complex I and Complex II results in insensitivity to TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis. In this study, inhibition of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by WA and Cel might have disrupted the balance between Complex I and Complex II, subsequently enhancing the pro-apoptotic effects of TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B, a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, is expressed in almost all cells and tissues. It regulates the expression of more than 500 genes that are involved in various biological events such as cellular transformation, proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis and inflammation <xref rid="pone.0113783-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The XIAP gene is one of the downstream effectors of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. When NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is activated, it up-regulates XIAP expression and thereby inhibits apoptosis, leading to evasion of TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated cytotoxicity and drug resistance <xref rid="pone.0113783-Stehlik1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our study found that natural products with proteasomal inhibitory activity suppressed NF-&#x003ba;B activation, resulting in inhibition of XIAP expression, leading to enhanced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. It has been proposed that these natural products could enhance the sensitivity of human breast cancer cells to TNF-&#x003b1; by disturbing the balance between complex I and complex II. WA and Cel, due to their proteasomal inhibitory activities enhance the pro-apoptotic role of TNF-&#x003b1; by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Also, by disturbing the balance between signal transduction pathways that are responsible for insensitivity or resistance to TNF-&#x003b1; signaling, WA and Cel might contribute to inhibition of the local inflammatory response. It can be speculated that this imbalance enhances the sensitivity of human breast cancer cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of TNF-&#x003b1;, ultimately leading to MDA-MB-231 cell death.</p><p>Our study is the first to demonstrate that the natural products, WA and Cel, via their proteasomal inhibitory properties, affect the balance between two pathways of TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis. We have shown that both WA and Cel reduce activation of NF-&#x003ba;B due to the TNF-&#x003b1; pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells in a similar fashion. The ubiquitin proteasome system is responsible for degradation of the majority of intracellular proteins and thus in turn controls various cellular processes, such as NF-&#x003ba;B activation via the degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0113783-Gupta2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Kanarek1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We have shown that WA and Cel inhibit proteasomal activities in MDA-MB-231 cells. It can be speculated that proteasome inhibition mediated by WA and Cel might also contribute to the suppression of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. Therefore, it is possible that multiple mechanisms are responsible for enhanced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells when TNF-&#x003b1; is combined with WA or Cel.</p><p>A myriad of cytokines are present in the tumor microenvironment that play a crucial role in tumor development. One such cytokine commonly found in the tumor microenvironment is TNF-&#x003b1;. It is involved in inflammation, transplant rejection, septic shock, tumor development and other pathological responses. Various studies indicate that TNF-&#x003b1; has a contradictory role in the tumor development. It promotes apoptosis as well as cell proliferation via regulation of the expression of many cytokines that promote tumor growth. Also, TNF-&#x003b1; levels have been suggested as a potential biomarker for prostate cancer as these are generally higher in tumor tissue than in normal tissue <xref rid="pone.0113783-Mandal1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Sung1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113783-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In accordance with this evidence, our results suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; sensitizes human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 to low doses of WA and Cel, leading to apoptosis due to suppression of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. These results underscore the potential of natural proteasome inhibitors as a therapy in certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, where inflammation plays major role in tumor growth.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113783-Aggarwal1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
