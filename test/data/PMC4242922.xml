nanostructures attain a larger surface to volume ratio
due to their small size and volume. The high surface to
volume ratio, especially in metallic nanostructures,
results in utterly different and sometimes unknown
electrical, magnetic and optical properties (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For
example, gold nanostructures (including nanoparticles,
nanorods and nanoshells) are able to absorb the energy
of laser radiation in the near infrared (NIR) region
and efficiently convert it to heat (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As gold
nanostructures are biocompatible, the heat can be
utilized in medical applications to damage malignant
cells and to treat cancer (photothermal therapy) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
The main problem of these treatments in practice is low
penetration depth of the laser (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition to NIR
lasers, other sources of electromagnetic spectrum such
as radiofrequency generators are used for various
purposes in medicine (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Non-invasive and non-ionizing
radiofrequency waves are able to penetrate
deep into the tissues; therefore, they can theoretically
be applied to the tissues in any part of the body.
Electromagnetic waves at frequencies of 13.56 and
27.12 MHz have been previously used to induce
hyperthermia effects as an adjuvant treatment
together with radiotherapy or chemotherapy (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The main problem in using RF waves is non-selectivity of tumor tissue as a target rather than surrounding healthy non-target tissues and its almost identical absorption in these tissues (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Over the past few years, several research groups have considered the targeted treatment of cancer cells by using RF radiation as primary treatment. They have done this by accumulating different nano-particles in malignant tissues (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In this regard, some <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have been conducted using gold nanostructures exposed to RF radiation. The results show more efficient apoptosis of target tissues compared to healthy tissue (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). There are theoretical debates about the reasons for these findings. However, it is not clear whether the heat produced via RF absorption by nanoparticles kills the target cells or direct biological effects of RF radiation, which are sub-lethal, become fatal in presence of nano-particles (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on different cell lines have been repeated, and the results demonstrate the additional effectiveness of gold nanostructures and RF fields in targeted destruction of cancer cells (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, according to the latest findings, the absorption of RF wave energy has been found to increase, provided that overall diameter of the particles is less than 10 nm (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The absorption of energy was also intensified by shell structure of the particles (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Au-Au2S (GGS) is a gold nanoshell with such features (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). GGS presence with exposure to RF radiation is expected to cause targeted killing of malignant cells effectively. GGS structure consists of a dielectric core made of gold sulfide with a thin shell of gold. The nanoshells can be synthesized by a very simple, cheap and controllable method, in contrast with similar morphological nanostructures (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Nanoshells with diameters generally less than 10 nm can also be synthesized. In addition, GGS similar to gold nanoparticle does not cause acute or chronic toxicity, easily penetrates the cells and can bind targeting agents (e.g. antibodies, peptides or pharmacological agents) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This study has investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of GGS exposed to RF radiation on the CT26 tumor model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Synthesis and characterization of GGS</title><p>By mixing aqueous solutions of HAuCl<sub>4</sub> (Alfa Aesar, USA) and Na2S (Merck, Germany), GGS was grown (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In fact, 20 ml of 2 mM HAuCl<sub>4</sub> was mixed with 20 &#x000b5;l of 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>S, and stored at 25&#x000b0;C for 1 day. A UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV 1700, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) was used to monitor the reaction at the wavelength range of 200-900 nm. After preparing the nanoparticles, 0.6 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO)n) was added to prevent nanoparticles aggregation. Finally, to purify GGS nanoshells, the particles were completely separated using sequential centrifugation procedure (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Then, we utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (CM 120, Philips, Germany) operating at acceleration voltage of 120 kV to examine the morphology of GGS. The size distribution of the nanoparticles was determined by means of a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer, Malvern Ins., USA). Furthermore, we exploited the UV-visible spectrophotometer in order to record the GGS UV-visible absorption spectrum.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>CT26 cell line (Pasteur Inst., Iran) derived from colon carcinoma of a BALB/c mouse was grown in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Life Technologies Corp., USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin. Cell culture was performed at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator (NU 8500, NuAire Corp., USA). The cells covered the bottom of the flask as a monolayer after 2-3 days of cell growth and proliferation. Exponentially growing cells were trypsinized using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. The cell count and survival rate were determined by a hemocytometer using trypan blue staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor model</title><p>Inbred 4-6 week BALB/c male mice weighting about 20 g were purchased from Iranian Pasteur Institute and kept under standard conditions of temperature, humidity, lighting and feeding in an animal house. In order to induce tumor models, the animals were subcutaneously injected by 5&#x000b4;10<sup>5</sup> viable CT26 cells suspended in 150 &#x000b5;l normal saline in the right flank. As the tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm<sup>3</sup> (10 days after injection), 5 mice were randomly sacrificed, autopsied and were subjected to the pathological examinations, and the presence of tumor was confirmed.</p></sec><sec><title>Anesthetizing the animals</title><p>To prevent animal movement during treatment, the mice were anesthetized before treating. For this purpose, 6 mg/kg Xylazine and 60 mg/kg Ketamine was injected intraperitoneally.</p></sec><sec><title>RF generator</title><p>We adapted variable power RF (at the frequency of 13.56 MHz) signal generator (Model 800 Crystal Brandmaster, Britcher Corp, USA) for our purposes in this test. The generating machine consisted of a power generator and adjustable distance transmitting/receiving couplers. A Spectrum Analyzer (HP 8566B, Hewlett-Packard, USA) was connected to the system to measure transmitted power. The process of impedance matching during RF exposure was so advantageous for monitoring and minimizing the reflected RF power.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>48 tumor bearing mice were randomly divided
into four groups. In each group, there were 7 mice
for follow-up and 5 mice for pathological studies. The
groups were as follows: Group 1: control, Group 2:
receiving GGS, Group 3: receiving RF radiation and
Group 4: receiving GGS with RF radiation. The mice
in groups 2 and 4 were intratumorally injected by 1
mg/kg GGS directly around various points of the
tumor (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Groups 3 and 4 were irradiated by
400W-power RF radiation for 4 min. To do this, the
completely shaved region of tumor was placed
between transmitter/receiver plates of RF signal
generator. The plates were fully insulated to prevent
electrical discharge and shock. In Group 4, the
irradiation was performed 20 min after injection of
the GGS (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of therapeutic efficacy</title><p>7 mice per group were considered for follow-up
treatment. Monitoring the effects of treatments was
performed by daily measurement of tumor diameters,
including small diameter (a), large diameter (b) and
thickness of tumor (c) using a digital vernier caliper
with accuracy of 0.01 mm. The volume of tumors (V)
was estimated using equation (1):
<disp-formula id="formula-qf-1"><label>(1)</label><italic>V</italic> = <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>/6(<italic>a</italic> &#x02219; <italic>b</italic> &#x02219; <italic>c</italic>) 
</disp-formula></p><p>The monitoring continued for 40 days after
treatment. The treatment day was considered as
a reference in order to do the final comparison;
the relative tumor volume on all days was
normalized to the volume on the reference day.
According to the daily changes in relative tumor
volume, the time needed for a 5-fold increase in
tumor volume (T<sub>5</sub>) was determined by regression
analysis in each group. Five mice per group were
considered for histopathological studies. The
pathologic examinations revealed the percentage of
necrosis in each tumor 24 hr after treatment day.
Using these results, reduction in volume of tumor
tissue was estimated 24 hr after treatment.</p><p>In order to perform histologic examinations on
tumors and evaluate the changes resulting from the
treatments, 5 animals in each group were sacrificed,
and the tumors were autopsied. Microscopic slides
prepared from tumor tissues were studied by a single
pathologist who was blinded to the treatment protocol,
and the percentage of necrosis was reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis of the data</title><p>All data were analyzed using SPSS 12 after
performing normality test and selecting the proper
comparative tests. According to the normality test of
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the data distribution was
normal. Therefore, one-way ANOVA with a
confidence level of 95% was used to compare the
data. Mutual comparisons between groups were
performed using Tukey test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>GGS characterization</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the diagram of particle size

Tumor growth became slow in the RF irradiated
group compared with the control group, but this
effect was significantly more pronounced in GGS+RF
group. Statistical analysis showed that on 10, 15, 20
and 25 days after treatment, there was no
statistically significant difference between relative
volume of tumor in control group compared to GGS group and also RF group (<italic>P</italic>=0.072). But during all these days, relative volume of tumors in GGS+RF group was significantly with GGS and control groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the relative volume of tumors in GGS+RF group and that in RF group (<italic>P</italic>=0.217).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the time required for a 5-fold increase in tumor volume in different groups.</p><p>The minimum and maximum T5 were determined as 7.3 and 12.4 days for control and GGS+RF receiving groups, respectively.

However, the difference between GGS+RF group and control or GGS groups were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.012).

However, significant differences between all groups in comparison with the GGS+RF group has been observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.013).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recently, the use of RF radiation together with nanoparticles (especially gold nanoparticles) has been noticed and discussed in order to induce lethal damage in malignant tissues. Present study also indicates the relative tumor volume was significantly reduced in the treatment group (GGS+RF waves) in comparison with the control group. These results are in agreement with the findings of Cardinal <italic>et al</italic> and Curley <italic>et al</italic>. However, the origins and mechanisms of damage to malignant tissue are not clearly identified. Based upon Moran <italic>et al</italic> studies, it seems that gold nanoparticles with diameters less than 50 nm cause a sudden rise in ambient temperature via energy absorption of RF and heat generation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As a result, by inserting the nanoparticles within the cancer cells and exposing them to RF radiation, irreversible damage can be inflicted to these cells, while due to the absence of nanoparticles in healthy tissues, these tissues suffer no harm. However, further detailed studies of Li <italic>et al</italic> have shown that the heat is due to ionic impurities associated with nanoparticles (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To reduce the effect of such factors, we purified nanoparticles according to Gobin <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Having removed the impurities, San <italic>et al</italic> and Corr <italic>et al</italic> determined that the diameter of nanoparticles should be less than 10 nm to generate suitable heat (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). GGS nanoshells used in this study had these features and were prepared under such conditions. In contrast with other gold nanoshells, GGS nanoshells in sizes smaller than 10 nm are easily and inexpensively synthesized. GGS injection creates no specific toxicity in animals. In this study, neither mortality nor other significant side effects have been observed in the GGS receiving group, like all other groups for 40 days after treatment, although no evidence of reduction in tumor volume was observed in the GGS group. In contrast, relative reduction in tumor volume was observed in the RF group, although this reduction was not significant compared to the control group, but also not negligible. Recent theoretical bioelectric studies of Iomin and experimental research of Palti <italic>et al</italic> suggest that RF waves have the ability to interrupt or interfere with the cell cycle (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Stupp <italic>et al</italic> have even utilized this phenomenon clinically for the treatment of GBM (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In addition, RF radiation to conductor environments such as living tissues inevitably induces high-frequency microcurrents. The presence of these microcurrents also impairs cellular processes (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). According to the above-mentioned reasons, reduction in relative volume of tumor RF seems to be justified. Moreover, recent studies of Raoof <italic>et al</italic> have shown that inherent permittivity of malignant tissues is more than that of normal tissues in the range of RF waves (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, RF waves cause temperature rise in malignant tissues compared to healthy tissues, after being exposed to RF radiation. This means that even without the presence of nanoparticles, it is expected that damage to malignant tissues be greater than to healthy tissues with RF radiation (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In this study, based on statistical analysis, this decline in tumor volume cannot be considered as an effective phenomenon in preventing tumor growth. However, based on theoretical studies of Tiwari <italic>et al</italic>, interruption or disruption of cell cycle due to RF waves was obviously increased in presence of nanoparticles, which disrupt space symmetry of living cells (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In this way, we can state another reason for obvious reduction in volume of tumor in GGS+RF compared to RF group. In the present study, regardless of the hyperthermic justification for the reduction in volume of tumor in GGS+RF group, it seems that GGS presence in the cells enhances the effect of RF radiation in stopping growth of the tumor. Based upon the reasons stated above, it seems that the presence of GGS biocompatible nanoshells in tumor cells perceptibly raises the thermal sub-lethal or bioelectric effects of RF, and these effects in turn inhibit tumor growth. The results of needed time for a 5-fold increase in volume of tumor also endorse the reasons. However, the results of lost tumor volume indicate significant differences for relative volume of tumor in GGS+RF group compared with all other groups, even irradiated RF group. In addition, it seems that the difference among the different treated groups gets stronger after 24 hr. However, over time and with proliferation of the tumor cells, this difference is blurred. As the damaging mechanisms usually act at the cellular level, causing no drastic genetic changes, reconstruction of tumor is not surprising over time. To get more definite results, we need fractionation of similar treatments with fractionated doses of ionizing radiation (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, more comprehensive radiobiological studies in this field seem to be necessary.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, RF waves in the absence of GGS caused no effective reduction in volume of the tumor. However, the GGS nanoshells in tumors exposed to noninvasive RF radiation decrease growth of the tumors. Although this was not the first time the simultaneous impact of nanoparticles and RF waves was observed, using GGS as a biocompatible as well as accessible and inexpensive nanoshell is a novelty.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was financially supported by Research Department of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.
