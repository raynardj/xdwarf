A common conception among plant ecologists is that flooding during the season when plants are dormant generally has little effect on the survival and production of riparian vegetation. We show that winter floods may also be of fundamental importance for the composition of riverine vegetation. We investigated the effects of ice formation on riparian and in-stream vegetation in northern Sweden using a combination of experiments and observations in 25 reaches, spanning a gradient from ice-free to ice-rich reaches. The ice-rich reaches were characterized by high production of frazil and anchor ice. In a couple of experiments, we exposed riparian vegetation to experimentally induced winter flooding, which reduced the dominant dwarf-shrub cover and led to colonization of a species-rich forb-dominated vegetation. In another experiment, natural winter floods caused by anchor-ice formation removed plant mimics both in the in-stream and in the riparian zone, further supporting the result that anchor ice maintains dynamic plant communities. With a warmer winter climate, ice-induced winter floods may first increase in frequency because of more frequent shifts between freezing and thawing during winter, but further warming and shortening of the winter might make them less common than today. If ice-induced winter floods become reduced in number because of a warming climate, an important disturbance agent for riparian and in-stream vegetation will be removed, leading to reduced species richness in streams and rivers in cold regions. Given that such regions are expected to have more plant species in the future because of immigration from the south, the distribution of species richness among habitats can be expected to show novel patterns.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anchor ice</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>in-stream mosses</kwd><kwd>northern Sweden</kwd><kwd>plants</kwd><kwd>riparian vegetation</kwd><kwd>streams</kwd><kwd>winter floods</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Riparian zones are dynamic, diverse, and fundamentally important landscape components in most parts of the world (Gregory et al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Naiman and D&#x000e9;camps <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Morris et al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Their dynamics are usually seen as a result of the flow regime during the ice-free period, in cold regions characterized by spring floods, summer low flows, and floods triggered by rainstorms in the autumn. Flooding affects plant growth directly by reducing respiration and photosynthesis during inundation (Van Eck et al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and indirectly by determining soil texture through erosion and sedimentation (Henry et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Floods can also cause physical injury to plants through scarring, bending, and uprooting (Kozlowski <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Species tolerance to flooding is therefore reflected in the zonation along elevation gradients in relation to the stream channel, with more flood-tolerant species at low elevations (Auble et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Nilsson <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Van Eck et al. <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Vegetation at low elevations often consists of annuals and biennials, and at higher levels of perennial, woody plants (Uunila <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Prowse and Culp <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). However, as an interface between aquatic and terrestrial environments, riparian zones are also exposed to ice action (Lind et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Streams in cold regions are subjected to specific hydrological processes that control flow regime, water levels, and ultimately biota (Hicks <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Stickler et al. <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The most important processes include the formation, growth, and breakdown of river ice during the winter, which represents a significant part of the year (Prowse and Beltaos <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Luke et al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). By creating obstacles to flow, stream and river ice can produce winter floods with magnitudes often exceeding those created by open-water conditions (Prowse and Beltaos <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The channels are characterized by different types of ice, and its formation depends upon variation in conditions such as local flow, meteorology, and topography (Stickler and Alfredsen <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). An ice cover can be formed in either a static or dynamic manner. A stable surface ice cover is most common in reaches with low velocity, whereas a dynamic ice cover characterizes more turbulent reaches (Beltaos <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In stream and river systems in cold regions, dynamic ice production is common when the air is cold and the water super-cooled (Stickler and Alfredsen <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Frazil ice (tiny ice crystals; Martin <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>) forms near the water surface, during super-cooled conditions, and can be transported to the streambed where it attaches to submerged objects such as boulders and vegetation, building up anchor ice and occasionally anchor-ice dams (Stickler and Alfredsen <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). As the temperature rises, anchor ice detaches, drifts downstream and often accumulates and may again form anchor-ice dams (Stickler and Alfredsen <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Anchor-ice dams, while building up, can cause flooding of riparian zones as the water level rises and the flow velocity decreases (Stickler et al. <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). When the anchor-ice dam eventually breaks due to elevated water stage and a higher pressure, it increases the flow velocity and the potential for physical disturbance to the riparian zone. As for floods during ice-free seasons, ice and ice-induced floods exert stress and disturbance to riparian and in-stream vegetation (Prowse <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Rood et al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lind et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, a main difference is that ice-related floods not only exert a physiological stress but also expose the vegetation to physical disturbance from freezing in ice and scouring from moving ice (Lind et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>It has been recognized that, as a result of ongoing climate change, northern regions will be exposed to a greater temperature increase than the global average (Andr&#x000e9;asson et al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In such regions, changes in temperature and precipitation during winter will result in more frequent shifts between ice thawing and freezing (Mote et al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Andr&#x000e9;asson et al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Winter is perceived as a bottleneck in the life history of plants and animals and the effects of a changing climate can be manifold (Beltaos <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As part of continued climate change, a stable ice cover may not even develop in many streams in cold regions (Prowse and Beltaos <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), exposing the in-stream biota to open-water conditions and reducing the disturbance of riparian vegetation. Climate change may also influence the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which could lead to an increase in ice production as the temperature decreases (Bryden et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). As the riparian zone provides many ecosystems services, such as nutrient retention and biodiversity (Nilsson and Ren&#x000f6;f&#x000e4;lt <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), it is important to investigate its response to a changing climate. Today, there is growing interest in research on the dynamics of stream and river ice as the effects of climate change on ice may have substantial economic and ecological consequences (Beltaos and Burrell <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>To increase the ability to predict species responses to future climate change, it is important to compare the plant composition among streams and rivers that differ in ice regime. We studied how different types of vegetation are impacted by different types of ice and winter floods. Specifically, we investigated how anchor ice and consequently winter floods influence the species composition of the riparian vegetation, and how the presence of ice affects the survival rate of vascular plants and in-stream mosses. Our study consisted of three parts. In the first part, we applied future climate scenarios to the study streams and identified four sets of geographically close, boreal streams that would represent two different stages in the predicted development of future ice regimes. It is, however, difficult to foresee changes in ice dynamics, for example where and when floods and anchor-ice dams will develop during winter (Rood et al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Therefore, in the second part, we exerted physiological stress and physical disturbance to the vegetation by watering riparian vegetation during cold weather. We mimicked two types of mid-winter flood events. In the first experiment, we exposed plots with riparian vegetation to flooding several times during winter to evaluate the effects of multiple flood events. In the second experiment, plots with riparian vegetation were exposed to a single extensive flood event. In the third part of the study, we quantified the physical force of naturally moving ice on riparian and in-stream vegetation using plant and moss mimics as meters. Specifically, we stuck wooden sticks in the riparian ground and attached moss transplants to in-stream boulders, and measured to what degree the sticks and transplants were eroded in streams with different ice regimes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study area</title><p>The study reaches were located in the county of V&#x000e4;sterbotten, northern Sweden. The reaches were situated in tributaries to the Ume and Vindel rivers, which originate in the Scandes Mountains and empty into the Gulf of Bothnia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). The Vindel and Ume rivers flow through a landscape formed by glaciations and crustal rebound, with till deposits dominating above and lacustrine sediment below the former highest coastline, which is formed by a pre-stage of the Baltic Sea (about 10,000 years ago). A total of 25 reaches were included in the winter survey, and reaches for the different experiments were selected among these. The study streams have their spring flood peaks due to snowmelt in April&#x02013;June. The riparian vegetation in a transverse profile across the study reaches is zoned with forest communities at the highest topographical position, followed by shrubs, and various graminoid and forb communities at the lower position (Nilsson <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). <italic>Carex</italic> spp. are the most abundant graminoids, whereas <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp. dominate the highest riparian elevations and the uplands.

Specific ice formations (e.g., anchor-ice dams and aufeis) were also indicated on the maps. To identify temporal changes in early and late winter, ice formation was surveyed using Wingscapes Time Lapse Plant Cameras, which were permanently placed at each reach. Cameras were set to take three pictures per day from October to the end of April. The cameras were, however, not reliable at temperatures below &#x02212;15&#x000b0;C. Based on the winter survey, the reaches were classified into three different groups based on the maximum spatial extent of anchor-ice cover of the entire wetted areas; one anchor-ice-rich group, with a high spatial extent of anchor-ice formation in the study reach (&#x0003e;30% anchor-ice cover), one with low spatial extent of anchor ice (5&#x02013;30%), and another that lacked an anchor-ice cover

Ume/Vindel River drainage area were obtained from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The obtained data included winter temperature (&#x000b0;C), winter precipitation (mm), number of days during winter with temperatures both below and above zero, that is, <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> &#x0003e; 0&#x000b0;C and <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b0;C, and length of growing season, that is, number of days with an average temperature &#x0003e;5&#x000b0;C. The meteorological period of 1961&#x02013;1991 was used as a validation and a reference for the models. The mean values of change in obtained data were based on calculations from nine global climate models under the RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 scenarios (CCCma-CanESM2, CNRM-CERFACS-CNRM-CM5, ICHEC-EC-EARTH, IPSL-IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC-MIROC5, MOHC-HadGEM2, MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, NCC-NorESM1-M, NOAA-GFDL-GFDL-ESM2M; SMHI <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The RCP 8.5 scenario is based on an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the RCP 4.5 scenario assumes reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Vegetation was inventoried in summer along four reaches that represent a future scenario of anchor-ice-free (0&#x02013;5%) and four that represent a future scenario of anchor-ice-rich reaches (&#x0003e;30%; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>: numbers 7&#x02013;14). Five transects were spaced at 10 m intervals along each reach, with plots (50 &#x000d7; 50 cm) at three elevations, (0, 40, and 80 cm) above the stream channel at summer low flow, to cover the whole riparian zone. The inventory included the percent cover of all vascular and nonvascular plants (&#x0003c;2 m high) rooted inside the plots, and the percent cover of bare soil and boulders, woody debris, and standing water, respectively. In some cases, two or more species were treated as one taxon: <italic>Carex juncella + C.nigra</italic>, <italic>Galium</italic> spp., <italic>Hieracium</italic> spp., <italic>Salix myrsinifolia</italic> + <italic>S. phylicifolia</italic>, <italic>Sparganium</italic> spp., and <italic>Taraxacum</italic> spp. Bryophytes included mosses and liverworts. The vegetation cover was summarized as cover of grasses, forbs, and woody plants, respectively. To evaluate differences in cover of these functional groups in relation to presence of ice, altitude in meter above sea level (MSL), elevation above the stream channel, and substrate (bare soil, boulders, woody debris and standing water), we used generalized linear models (GLM) with quasi-Poisson distribution to correct for overdispersion. All analyses were performed using R version 2.15.2 (R Development Core Team <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), if not stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple floods</title><p>To study the effects of multiple floods during winter, we used our set of study reaches to select four anchor-ice-rich reaches (&#x0003e;30%) and four anchor-ice-free reaches (0&#x02013;5%; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>: numbers 1&#x02013;8). The reaches were located in tributaries to the Ume River and were situated within 40 km from the city of Ume&#x000e5; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). In each reach, four turbulent sections were selected as the production of frazil and anchor ice is higher in turbulent than in tranquil sections. Two different riparian elevations (40 and 80 cm above the summer low flow) were identified in each section, using a clinometer and a rod. To create an ice cover through watering by hand, 15-cm-high circular plastic frames were anchored to the ground to keep water from flowing out. To be able to anchor the frames, the plots were restricted to a diameter of 25 cm. The plots were placed in the riparian zone in the middle of each turbulent section, and eight plots were located at each elevation. To find the plots under snow, this was gently removed before watering, and replaced afterward. In each plot, 30 L of water was slowly poured inside the frames until the whole water volume was absorbed and an ice layer started to form. The watering was conducted during 4 days distributed between November and February in the winter 2011&#x02013;2012, during which time temperatures remained below &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C. The vegetation cover in the plots was quantified before the experiment, in July&#x02013;August 2011. Four control plots at each elevation and section, not subjected to the experimental watering, were also inventoried. Vegetation was inventoried by percent cover of species according to the same premises as previously described in the methods section for future climate scenarios. In the summer 2012, the plots were re-inventoried, and visible vegetation damage such as frost burns was recorded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>A and B).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Flooding experiment in the riparian zone.

The test was run for three different sets of groups. We defined the sets of groups as (1) plots along anchor-ice-rich and anchor-ice-free reaches before versus after the watering treatment, to separate the treatment effect from the natural disturbance; (2) plots from anchor-ice-rich versus anchor-ice-free reaches after watering treatment; and (3) untreated control plots from 2011 versus 2012 to account for in-between year differences. The MRPP provides the test statistic <italic>T,</italic> which is more negative the stronger the separation is between the groups. It also provides a <italic>P</italic>-value, associated with <italic>T</italic>. The MRPP also supplies a description of the effect size, independent of the sample, by the chance-corrected within-group agreement (<italic>A</italic>). <italic>A</italic> describes within-group homogeneity compared to the random exceptions: <italic>A</italic> &#x0003c; 0 with more heterogeneity within groups than expected by chance; <italic>A</italic> = 0 when heterogeneity within groups equals expectation by chance; <italic>A</italic> = 1 when all items are identical within groups.</p><p>Analysis of species richness and multivariate analyses were performed in PC-Ord version 6.0. Differences in species richness were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses were also applied on the control plot data to exclude interannual differences. To evaluate the effects on riparian bryophytes exposed to the flooding experiment, we used linear mixed-effects models (LME) with two random factors that nested the plots within elevation and reach. The same type of analysis was used to compare the cover of different functional groups before and after the flooding experiments and in the control plots, with stream as a random factor. The R package nlme was used in the mixed-effects models analysis (Pinheiro et al. <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). All analyses were performed using R version 2.15.2 (R Development Core Team <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), if not stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec><title>Single extended flood</title><p>To study the combined effect of flowing water and freezing, we created extended flooding by pumping water from the stream to the riparian area during cold (&#x0003c;&#x02212;15&#x000b0;C), snow-free days in early winter. The experiment was made in four of the reaches that were included in the multiple flooding experiment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>: numbers 4&#x02013;7). Plots were placed in the riparian zone in the middle of each turbulent section. Watering was applied at each reach in four plots (50 &#x000d7; 50 cm) at two elevations (40 and 80 cm above the summer low water level). The size of the plots was larger than in the multiple floods experiment as the number of plots was restricted by the use of water pumps, whereas the size was not restricted by any use of frames. During 4 h, which was constrained by cold weather and the short days, about 3200 L/h of water was pumped from the stream (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>C). The plots were inventoried before the experiment, in July&#x02013;August 2012 and re-inventoried in the summer 2013. Four control plots at each elevation were also inventoried. All vegetation inventories and statistical analysis were preformed according to the same premises as described in the methods for the multiple floods experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Mimicking in-stream mosses</title><p>To evaluate the effects of the physical disturbance of flow and ice on bryophytes, we used transplants of the dominant in-stream moss in boreal areas, <italic>Fontinalis</italic> spp., collected in reaches not included in any other study. The samples were washed to remove any epiphytes or detritus, dried, weighed, and then affixed to Velcro strips (5 &#x000d7; 7 cm). The moss mimics were thereafter attached to boulders in Mattjokkb&#x000e4;cken N and Beukab&#x000e4;cken S (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>: numbers 9&#x02013;10). The reach in Mattjokkb&#x000e4;cken is anchor-ice rich (&#x0003e;30% cover), whereas the reach in Beukab&#x000e4;cken is anchor-ice free (0&#x02013;5% cover). The two streams were restored in 2010 whereby boulders from adjacent upland heaps were replaced to the channel; the boulders were therefore missing a natural, in-stream bryophyte community. Strong instant glue was used to secure the Velcro strips onto the upstream and downstream sides of 15 boulders in each stream in turbulent reaches at low flow. Bryophytes have a large capacity of regaining strength after drying when being re-wetted (Csintalan et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>); however, some loss of strength was expected. Current velocity was measured during summer low flow both upstream and downstream of the boulders using a hand-held velocity recorder (Valeport, Model 801). After one winter, the Velcro strips with the remaining <italic>Fontinalis</italic> were collected. The <italic>Fontinalis</italic> transplants were then removed from the Velcro strip and again dried in 65&#x000b0;C to constant weight. To quantify the difference in moss weight before and after the winter season along an anchor-ice-rich and an anchor-ice-free reach, we used generalized mixed-effect model (GLM) with Poisson distribution as the data were not normally distributed. Position on boulder (upstream or downstream) and current velocity at each boulder were also included as factors in the analysis. All analyses were performed using R version 2.15.2 (R Development Core Team <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mimicking vascular plants</title><p>In this part of the study, all 25 reaches were included (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>: numbers 1&#x02013;25). We used bamboo sticks to mimic vascular plants during two winters, 2011&#x02013;2013 (Dong et al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Kohler et al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Tsujino and Yumoto <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Ten sticks (30 cm long, 5 mm thick) were placed in 15 plots, which were evenly spread with a 10 m interval and among three elevations, (0, 40, and 80 cm) above the stream channel at summer low flow. Sticks were pushed 10 cm down in the substrate along all reaches. In the following year, the sticks were counted and categorized as broken, missing, or unimpacted. A total of 3750 sticks/year were used in the study, meaning that 1250 sticks were placed at each elevation. During the second study year, one of the reaches was affected by logging and therefore excluded from the study. To evaluate the effects of anchor ice on plant mimics (sticks), we used LME with two random factors that nested the sticks within elevation and stream.

As an illustration of extreme cases, we let four streams represent an anchor-ice-rich, and four streams an anchor-ice-free situation. An inventory of the streams showed that these differences also played a role in terms of plant community composition. The anchor-ice-rich streams had a higher cover of forbs in the riparian zone (Estimate = Est.) = 1.2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.00052), whereas a different pattern was shown for the anchor-ice-free streams (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>).

With an increasing number of shifts between freezing and thawing, we can foresee an initial increase in the production of frazil and anchor ice. However, as the overall air temperature is also increasing, reducing the length of winters, the production of frazil and anchor ice might decrease toward the end of this century (Beltaos et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Nilsson et al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The formation of surface ice will be delayed as water and air temperatures increase during autumn, and the interval between the first ice formation event and the final freeze-up will lengthen (Prowse and Beltaos <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The entire freeze-up cycle can also change as increased flow in winter, as a result of less precipitation falling as snow, may alter the strength and the thickness of the ice cover. This would mean that more streams might stay ice-free longer, and more streams could remain ice-free during the whole year (Prowse et al. <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Winter flooding and river ice breakup are important events for the water budget and the plant species richness. If the magnitude of ice breakups and the frequency of winter floods decrease, the plant composition in the riparian zone will change (Lind and Nilsson unpublished data). Available evidence suggests that an increase in anchor-ice production will lead to more species in the riparian zone, whereas a decrease and eventual disappearance of ice will reduce species richness (Engstr&#x000f6;m et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, the proportion of forbs will be highest along anchor-ice-rich streams, whereas the proportion of dwarf-shrubs will be highest along anchor-ice-free streams. The observed differences in the proportions of forbs and dwarf-shrubs between the anchor-ice-rich and the anchor-ice-free streams support this prediction, even if the mechanisms are not revealed. We therefore made experiments to fill this knowledge gap.</p><p>It has previously been shown that plant species vary in their response to summer floods and especially longer periods of inundation (Kozlowski <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Van Eck et al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Our watering experiments in the riparian zone demonstrate that winter floods, most of which are induced by anchor-ice formation, can represent an important disturbance to riparian vegetation. Even though the experimental setup and the frequency of floods were different, the riparian disturbances caused by both experiments were similar in nature. Both our experiments suppressed woody plants through frost damage and favored forbs, which led to an increase in species richness (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Grasses, on the other hand, did not react to the 1-year experiments, probably because they have their budding parts below or close to the ground and remain dormant during winter, which make them less sensitive to winter floods (Engstr&#x000f6;m et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lind and Nilsson unpublished data).</p><p>The community composition did not change in any of the experiments even though the species richness increased. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the percent cover of dwarf-shrubs (such as <italic>V. myrtillus</italic>) whereas forbs increased in cover (such as <italic>F. ulmaria</italic>). This suggests that the differences in plant communities along anchor-ice-rich reaches are species specific, with some being favored while others are disfavored. The watering experiments do not include all types of physical disturbance that ice and winter floods might induce on riparian vegetation. For example, ice breakup and ice scouring are not mimicked and could potentially have caused a strong direct effect on plant community composition. Along reaches where plants annually and repeatedly experience flooding or ice events, the effects on community composition are evident, showing the difference between the chronic disturbances versus short-term experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). The reasons for plant responses to winter flooding vary among species. For example, <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp. were reduced in cover as they are evergreen and sensitive to freezing and may suffer from frost burn if they start photosynthesizing while their basal parts are still being frozen into ice (Bokhorst et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). A high number of <italic>V. myrtillus</italic> shoots were damaged and reduced in cover by both flooding experiments, opening up patches for forbs to colonize (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>A). This mechanism could also explain the expansion of <italic>F. ulmaria</italic>. Plants close to the stream channel may also be affected by ice movement and ice jamming during ice breakup and by ice sheets detaching from the riparian zone (Lind et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The fact that most wooden sticks were missing along anchor-ice-rich reaches, and in the plots closest to the stream channel, supports this view. Ice mechanically erodes riparian soil and vegetation and thereby favors establishment of new species (Rood et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The suggested role of anchor ice is supported by the finding that there was no difference in the number of broken sticks between anchor-ice-rich and anchor-ice-free reaches, as the ice would transport the sticks. Broken sticks were most common in plots farther away from the stream channel and were most likely caused by trampling (by animals or humans), as all broken pieces were still present on the site, and thereby not likely caused by ice movement.</p><p>The reason we did not observe any difference in riparian bryophyte cover after the flooding experiments probably reflects the fact that bryophytes are more resistant to freezing than are vascular plants (Minami et al. <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), suggesting that 1-year experiments are probably too short to have an impact. The observation that anchor-ice-free reaches had a higher cover of riparian bryophytes supports this conclusion. In contrast, in-stream moss transplants showed a clear response to anchor ice, reflecting a more direct effect by ice. This difference may be caused by the canopy-forming stature of <italic>Fontinalis</italic>, making it more sensitive to disturbance. The fact that the <italic>Fontinalis</italic> transplants were dried, and probably less elastic, could also have played a role. According to Muotka and Virtanen (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), <italic>Fontinalis</italic> species are rather indifferent in their choice of habitat although they form their densest stands at the most stable sites, in this case the anchor-ice-free sites.</p><p>We conclude that a dynamic flooding regime during winter, often associated with anchor-ice formation, may be a key component for favoring riparian plant diversity along boreal streams and rivers. The climate change scenarios for this boreal area indicate that ice-induced winter floods will be less likely by the end of the present century, suggesting that the species-rich riparian vegetation in streams and rivers in cold regions will change slowly from forb to dwarf-shrub dominance and that the species richness will decrease accordingly. A common view among researchers is that predicted climate changes will lead many species to shift their distribution limits northward and upward and result in generally higher species richness in currently cold regions (Pauli et al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Garamv&#x000f6;lgyi and Hufnagel <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). If the special position of riparian zones as being the most species-rich habitats in such regions becomes less pronounced, the future distribution of species richness among habitats in currently cold regions is likely to exhibit novel patterns.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank S.
