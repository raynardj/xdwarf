Previous studies demonstrated that melatonin protected against LPS-induced fetal demise, IUGR and preterm delivery. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on LPS-induced NTDs. All pregnant mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (25 &#x000b5;g/kg) daily from gestational day (GD)8 to GD12. Some pregnant mice were orally administered with melatonin (MT, 50 mg/kg) before each LPS injection. A five-day LPS injection resulted in 27.5% of fetuses with anencephaly, exencephaly or encephalomeningocele. Additional experiment showed that maternal LPS exposure significantly down-regulated placental <italic>proton-coupled folate transporter</italic> (<italic>pcft</italic>) and disturbed folate transport from maternal circulation through the placentas into the fetus. Interestingly, melatonin significantly attenuated LPS-induced down-regulation of placental <italic>pcft</italic>. Moreover, melatonin markedly improved the transport of folate from maternal circulation through the placentas into the fetus. Correspondingly, orally administered melatonin reduced the incidence of LPS-induced anencephaly, exencephaly or encephalomeningocele. Taken together, these results suggest that orally administered melatonin prevents LPS-induced NTDs through alleviating LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport from maternal circulation through the placenta into the fetus.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81172711).

Humans are constantly exposed to a low concentration of LPS through infection. Gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and excess alcohol intake are known to increase permeability of LPS from gastrointestinal tract into blood <xref rid="pone.0113763-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. LPS has been associated with adverse pregnant outcomes in rodent animals. According to an earlier report, mice exposed to LPS at early gestational stage caused embryonic resorption <xref rid="pone.0113763-Ogando1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

Moreover, inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) are involved in LPS-induced preterm delivery, fetal demise and IUGR <xref rid="pone.0113763-Leazer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113763-Xu4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, melatonin, the major secretory product of the pineal gland, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

All dams were sacrificed at 9:00 AM on GD18 and gravid uterine weights were recorded. For each litter, the numbers of live fetuses, dead fetuses and resorption sites were counted. Live fetuses were weighed and examined for external morphological malformations. All fetuses were then stored in ethanol a minimum of two weeks for subsequent skeletal evaluation. To investigate the effects of orally administered melatonin on folate contents in maternal sera and mouse embryos, forty-eight pregnant mice were divided into four groups randomly.

In melatonin alone group, pregnant mice were orally administered melatonin (50 mg/kg) by gavage 1 h before each NS injection. Pregnant mice were sacrificed 12 h after the last LPS injection. Maternal sera and embryos were collected for measurements of folate contents. To investigate the effects of melatonin on the expression of placental folate transportors, twenty-four pregnant mice were divided into four groups randomly. In LPS group, pregnant mice were i.p. injected with a single dose of LPS (25 &#x000b5;g/kg) at 9:00 AM on GD10.

A recent study showed that subcutaneous implantation with melatonin protected against LPS-induced preterm delivery <xref rid="pone.0113763-DominguezRubio1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The present study investigated the effect of orally administered melatonin on LPS-induced NTDs. Our results showed that orally administered melatonin reduced the incidence of LPS-induced NTDs from 27.5% to 13.3%. Moreover, orally administered melatonin significantly protected against LPS-induced skeletal malformation. These results suggest that melatonin prevents not only LPS-induced preterm delivery and IUGR but also NTDs and skeletal malformation, which expands the protective effects of melatonin against LPS-induced developmental toxicity.</p><p>Folate plays a crucial role on one-carbon metabolism for physiological DNA synthesis and cell division <xref rid="pone.0113763-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Increasing evidence demonstrates that maternal folate deficiency during pregnancy is major etiology for fetal NTDs <xref rid="pone.0113763-Fleming1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Indeed, a recent report from our laboratory showed that maternal folate supplementation during pregnancy prevented LPS-induced NTDs in mice <xref rid="pone.0113763-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, it is especially interesting whether maternal LPS exposure influences folate metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we measured folate content in maternal sera and embryos. Despite of no difference on folate content in maternal sera between LPS-treated dams and controls, embryonic folate content was markedly reduced when pregnant mice were injected with LPS during organogenesis, indicating that maternal LPS exposure disturbs folate transport from maternal circulation into the fetus. Interestingly, LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport was attenuated when pregnant mice were orally administered with melatonin before LPS injection. Indeed, the placentas mediate uptake of folates from maternal circulation to the developing embryos, which are critically important for cell proliferation and the development of critical structures, such as the embryonic neural tube <xref rid="pone.0113763-Farkas1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that melatonin protects against LPS-induced NTDs, at least partially, through attenuating LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport from maternal circulation through the placenta into the fetus.</p><p>The transport of folate from maternal circulation through the placenta into the fetus is mediated by several specific transporters, including folate receptors (mainly FR&#x003b1;) and folate transporters (mainly PCFT) <xref rid="pone.0113763-Zhao3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. According to several recent reports, FR-&#x003b1; and PCFT are highly expressed in human and rodent placentas during early embryonic development <xref rid="pone.0113763-Solanky1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113763-Cherukad1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The present study showed that no significant difference on the expression of placental <italic>fr</italic>&#x003b1; was observed among different groups. By contrast, <italic>pcft</italic>, major folate transporter in placenta, was markedly down-regulated when pregnant mice were injected with LPS during organogenesis. As melatonin alleviates LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport from maternal circulation through the placenta into the fetus, we further analyze the effects of melatonin on placental folate transporters. As expected, melatonin alone had no effect on the expression of folate transporters in placentas. Interestingly, LPS-induced down-regulation of placental <italic>pcft</italic> was obviously attenuated in mice pretreated with melatonin. These results suggest that melatonin improves folate transport from maternal circulation into the fetus through attenuating LPS-induced down-regulation of <italic>pcft</italic>.in placenta.</p><p>The mechanism through which melatonin attenuates LPS-induced down-regulation of placental <italic>pcft</italic> remains obscure. Increasing evidence demonstrates that melatonin has an anti-inflammatory effect <xref rid="pone.0113763-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113763-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. According to an earlier report from our laboratory, orally administered melatonin during pregnancy inhibits LPS-evoked release of TNF-&#x003b1; in maternal serum <xref rid="pone.0113763-Xu5" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The present study found that orally administered melatonin during pregnancy almost completely repressed LPS-induced up-regulation of <italic>tnf-</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>il-6</italic>, <italic>mcp-1</italic> and <italic>mip-2</italic> in mouse placenta. Although no direct evidence demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines could regulate placental folate transporters, TNF-&#x003b1;, a major inflammatory cytokine, significantly repressed folate uptake by human placental BeWo cells <xref rid="pone.0113763-Araujo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, indicating that TNF-&#x003b1; is, at least partially, involved in LPS-induced down-regulation of placental <italic>pcft</italic>. Therefore, we speculate that melatonin might attenuate LPS-induced down-regulation of placental <italic>pcft</italic> through its anti-inflammatory activity.</p><p>According to an earlier report, maternally administered melatonin prevented ischemia/reperfusion-induced placental oxidative mitochondrial damage and IUGR <xref rid="pone.0113763-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Another study found that orally administered melatonin significantly improved placental efficiency and birth weight by upregulating placental antioxidant enzymes <xref rid="pone.0113763-Richter1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A recent report showed that antenatal melatonin administration significantly reduced fetoplacental oxidative stress and prevented IUGR-associated newborn neurodevelopmental deficits and brain injury <xref rid="pone.0113763-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The present study found that orally administered melatonin protected against LPS-induced NTDs through attenuating LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport from maternal circulation through the placenta into the fetus. However, the present study has several limitations. First, the present study only investigated the effects of a single dose melatonin on LPS-induced placental folate transport and fetal NTDs. Second, the present study only investigated the effects of pretreatment with melatonin on LPS-induced placental folate transport and fetal NTDs. Thus, additional work is required to determine a dose response curve to assess the effects of different doses melatonin on LPS-induced placental folate transport and fetal NTDs. In addition, the protective effects of melatonin against NTDs need to be demonstrated in different models of NTDs.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates for the first time that orally administered melatonin attenuates LPS-induced down-regulation of placental folate transporters. Correspondingly, orally administered melatonin alleviates LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport from maternal circulation into the fetus through its anti-inflammatory activity. Importantly, orally administered melatonin prevents LPS-induced NTDs. Thus, melatonin may have a potential preventive utility for protecting against inflammation-associated fetal NTDs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113763-Jacob1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
