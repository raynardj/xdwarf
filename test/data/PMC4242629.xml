However, information is limited about the bacterial nitrifiers and denitrifiers and their functional genes in tannery wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to the low-throughput of the previously used methods. In this study, 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina high-throughput sequencing, combined with molecular methods, were used to comprehensively characterize structures and functions of nitrification and denitrification bacterial communities in aerobic and anaerobic sludge of two full-scale tannery WWTPs. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Synergistetes</italic> dominated in the aerobic and anaerobic sludge, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) <italic>amoA</italic> gene cloning revealed that <italic>Nitrosomonas europaea</italic> dominated the ammonia-oxidizing community in the WWTPs. Metagenomic analysis showed that the denitrifiers mainly included the genera of <italic>Thauera</italic>, <italic>Paracoccus</italic>, <italic>Hyphomicrobium</italic>, <italic>Comamonas</italic> and <italic>Azoarcus</italic>, which may greatly contribute to the nitrogen removal in the two WWTPs. It is interesting that AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea had low abundance although both WWTPs demonstrated high ammonium removal efficiency. Good correlation between the qPCR and metagenomic analysis is observed for the quantification of functional genes <italic>amoA</italic>, <italic>nirK</italic>, <italic>nirS</italic> and <italic>nosZ</italic>, indicating that the metagenomic approach may be a promising method used to comprehensively investigate the abundance of functional genes of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51378252, PI: BL, URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn</ext-link>), National Science and Technology Major Project of China (No. 2011ZX07210-001-1, PI: AL, URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nmp.gov.cn/">http://www.nmp.gov.cn/</ext-link>) and Technology Support Project of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BE2011722, PI: BL; Grant No. BE2013704, PI: XXZ; URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jskjjh.gov.cn">www.jskjjh.gov.cn</ext-link>).

Nitrification, the biological oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate, is carried out in two sequential steps via several phylogenetically distinct groups of microorganisms: ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) <xref rid="pone.0113603-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Denitrification consists of consecutive reactions including transformation of nitrate or nitrite into gaseous forms (N<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub>O) by different groups of bacteria (nitrifiers and denitrifiers) <xref rid="pone.0113603-Geets1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Due to the technological difficulty in isolation and culture of bacterial nitrifiers and denitrifiers, molecular methods have been widely used to analyze diversity and abundance of microorganisms involved in nitrification/denitrification in various environments, such as soil <xref rid="pone.0113603-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and activated sludge <xref rid="pone.0113603-Geets1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

However, the metagenomic methods have not been used for comprehensive insights into the communities of nitrifies and denitrifies in tannery WWTPs.</p><p>In this study, 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene was conducted to determine the bacterial community structure of activated sludge sampled from two full-scale tannery WWTPs, and Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to comprehensively investigate functional genes involved in the bacterial nitrification and denitrification. To confirm the metagenomic results, quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify the functional genes encoding subunits of the ammonia monooxygenase (<italic>amoA</italic>), nitrite reductases (<italic>nirK</italic> and <italic>nirS</italic>) and nitrous oxide reductase (<italic>nosZ</italic>). Since ammonia oxidation is a rate-limiting step in nitrification, the <italic>amoA</italic> gene was chosen for genetic diversity analysis using DNA cloning and sequencing technology.

We would like to state that the two companies have approved this study which did not involve endangered or protected species. The two WWTPs basically involve a biological treatment system preceded by preliminary treatment (homogenization, chemical coagulation and primary settling). As described in our previous study <xref rid="pone.0113603-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the biological treatment system of WWTPA was composed of an up-flow anaerobic sludge reactor (UASB) and an integrated anoxic/oxic (A/O) reactor, while WWTPB was composed of an oxidation ditch and an integrated anoxic/oxic (A/O) reactor. Relevant operational parameters about the two biological systems are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113603.s010">Table S1</xref>. Although the two WWTPs differed in the influent water quality and operational conditions, they both achieved high ammonia removal efficiencies (&#x0003e;97%). Thus, we chose the two WWTPs to explore the functional nitrifiers and denitrifiers responsible for the high ammonia removal. Four sludge samples were collected from the two WWTPs, including one anaerobic sludge sample (A-A) from the UASB and one aerobic sludge sample (A-O) from the last aerobic tank of the A/O reactor in WWTPA, and two aerobic sludge samples separately collected from the oxidation ditch (B-D) and the last aerobic tank of the A/O reactor (B-O) in WWTPB. The sludge samples were fixed with 50% ethanol (v/v) on site before transporting to laboratory for DNA extraction. The fixed sludge was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min to collect approximately 200 mg of the pellet for total genomic DNA extraction with the FastDNA Soil Kit (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA). The concentration and quality of the extracted DNA were determined with microspectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Willmington, DE, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PCR amplification, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of amoA gene</title><p>PCR of AOA and AOB <italic>amoA</italic> genes was conducted by using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113603.s011">Table S2</xref>.

To maximize the reliability of the obtained results, only the highly abundant genera identified by both pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing in this study were considered as the main nitrifiers or denitrifiers in the two tannery WWTPs.</p><p>All the <italic>amoA</italic> gene reads were assigned to <italic>Nitrosomonas</italic>, which agrees with <italic>amoA</italic> gene cloning results. Results showed that <italic>Nitrosomonas</italic> was the main host of nitrite reductase gene <italic>nirK</italic> in the samples A-A, B-D and B-O. This result is supported by Beaumont et al. <xref rid="pone.0113603-Beaumont1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> indicating presence of <italic>nirK</italic> in <italic>Nitrosomonas europaea</italic> cells. Interestingly, <italic>nirK</italic> in sample A-O was mainly carried by the bacterial cells of <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, not <italic>Nitrosomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113603.s009">Figure S9</xref>). This is consistent with the pyrosequencing results demonstrating that <italic>Rhizobium</italic> had high abundance in sample A-O (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113603.s013">Table S4</xref>). <italic>NirS</italic> and <italic>nosZ</italic> genes were found mainly located in the bacterial cells of <italic>Thauera</italic>, <italic>Paracoccus</italic>, <italic>Hyphomicrobium</italic>, <italic>Comamonas</italic> and <italic>Azoarcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113603.s009">Figure S9</xref>) dominating in the aerobic sludge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113603.s013">Table S4</xref>), revealing the crucial roles of the microorganisms in denitrification in aerobic environments. It is known that <italic>Thaurea mechernichensis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113603-Scholten1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and <italic>Paracoccus denitrificans</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113603-Baumann1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> can reduce nitrate even in the presence of high concentrations of O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In conclusion, combined use of DNA cloning, qPCR, 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing provided a comprehensive insight in microbial community structure of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in tannery WWTPs. <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Synergistetes</italic> phyla had highest abundance in aerobic and anaerobic sludge, respecitively. <italic>Nitrosomonas europaea</italic> dominated the ammonia-oxidizing community. <italic>Thauera</italic>, <italic>Paracoccus</italic>, <italic>Hyphomicrobium</italic>, <italic>Comamonas</italic> and <italic>Azoarcus</italic> were the predominant potential denitrifying genera, which may greatly contribute to the nitrogen removal in the WWTPs. qPCR and metagenomic approaches consistently revealed that functional genes <italic>amoA</italic>, <italic>nirK</italic>, <italic>nirS</italic> and <italic>nosZ</italic> had higher abundance in aerobic sludge than in anaerobic sludge. The results can extend our biological knowledge about nitrifiers and denitrifiers in tannery WWTPs, and might be practically useful in efficiently removing nitrogen from industrial wastewater.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113603.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
