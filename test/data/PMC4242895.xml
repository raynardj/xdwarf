If first-tier therapy is ineffective, second-tier therapy must be initiated. In many cases, the full arsenal of established treatment options is available. However, situations occasionally arise in which only a narrow range of options is available to neurointensivists. We present a rare clinical scenario in which therapeutic hypothermia was the only available method for controlling intracranial pressure and that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of the Thermogard (Zoll, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, United States) cooling system in creating and maintaining a prolonged hypothermic state. The lifesaving effect of hypothermia was overshadowed by the unfavorable neurologic outcome observed (minimally conscious state on intensive care unit discharge). These results add further evidence to support the role of therapeutic hypothermia in managing intracranial pressure and provide motivation for finding new strategies in combination with hypothermia to improve neurologic outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>therapeutic hypothermia</kwd><kwd>meningitis</kwd><kwd>intracranial pressure</kwd><kwd>intracranial hypertension</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is one of the fundamental problems in neurocritical care.

On arrival the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 9/15 (E1V3M5) with episodes of stereotypic movements. There was a marked right hemiparesis with a Medical Research Council grade 3/5 weakness of the right arm proximally and distally and 0/5 weakness in the right leg. The left side was normal. Visual examination demonstrated a bilateral amaurosis with right abducens and bilateral oculomotor palsies. Panhypopituitarism was evidenced by bradycardia (50&#x02013;55 bpm), reduced intestinal peristalsis, mild hyponatremia (129&#x02013;132 mmol/L), and low levels of circulating adrenocorticoid, thyroid, and gonadotropic hormones and insulinlike growth factor 1. Blood pressure (BP) was normal (120/80&#x02009;mm Hg), as was his respiratory rate (RR). Treatment with hydrocortisone (400 mg/day intravenously) and levothyroxine (3 &#x003bc;g/kg/day via nasogastric tube) was started immediately.</p><p>The following day, an endoscopic transsphenoidal removal of the tumor and attendant blood clots was successfully performed (<xref rid="FI140022-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). An external lumbar drain was inserted immediately prior to the procedure. A further drain was inserted into the tumor cavity following resection for postoperative hemorrhage control. Histologic examination excluded pituitary adenoma and instead confirmed a diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. The patient was successfully extubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) 3 hours postoperatively. The right hemiparesis and visual loss were unchanged.</p><fig id="FI140022-2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

Lumbar drainage was removed on the second postoperative day; the tumor cavity drain was removed on day 5. GCS improved from 9/15 (E1V3M5) at extubation to 12/15 (E1V5M6) on day 5. Motor function in the right limbs also improved to 5/5 in the right arm and 4/5 in the right leg. On the left, visual acuity improved to 20/40 and cranial nerve deficits resolved, although the visual fields were narrowed. There was no visual function in the right eye, and the right abducens palsy remained. Vital signs were stable (BP: 120/80&#x02013;130/80&#x02009;mm Hg; heart rate [HR]: 55&#x02013;65 bpm, RR: 12&#x02013;15/min), and electrolyte disturbances were corrected (Na<sup>+</sup>: 135&#x02013;140 mmol/L).</p><p>The patient was discharged on day 12 to the neurosurgical ward where rehabilitation continued and the patient was able to walk with assistance. Sudden cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea occurred when the patient blew his nose on the postoperative day 15. A combined intranasal spray (polydexa, comprising neomycin, polymyxin B, dexamethasone, and phenylephrine) was administered. The next day, the patient experienced a generalized seizure despite prophylactic antiepileptic valproate therapy. Seizure activity was terminated with benzodiazepines, but the patient's GCS was 8/15 (E1V2M5), and he was intubated, ventilated, and returned to the ICU. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed pneumocephalus (<xref rid="FI140022-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="FI140022-3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>

The source of the leak was located in the capsule of the previously resected tumor and successfully sealed. The patient returned to the ICU sedated with propofol, intubated, and mechanically ventilated.

ICP confirmed severe ICH (25&#x02013;35&#x02009;mm Hg) that proved refractory to first-tier therapy with optimal bed positioning, propofol sedation, fentanyl analgesia, paralysis with intravenous pipecuronium 0.05 mg/kg/hour, 250 mL intravenous hyperosmolar solution (HyperHAES, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), and external ventricular drainage. CSF analysis confirmed the cause of ICH to be meningitis, with a CSF cell count of 14592/&#x000b5;L, glucose of 0.2 mmol/L, and lactate of 17 mmol/L. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) demonstrated increased mean velocity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow of up to 116 cm/second with an associated maximal Lindegaard index of 3.4. The patient was hemodynamically unstable (BP: 80/40&#x02013;85/45&#x02009;mm Hg; HR: 50&#x02013;60 bpm) and required a 0.03 to 0.05 &#x000b5;g/kg/minute norepinephrine infusion to maintain a target mean arterial pressure of 95&#x02013;110&#x02009;mm Hg. C-reactive protein was elevated at 156 mg/dL, significantly increased from 0.1 mg/dL 3 days previously. A fever of 39&#x000b0;C developed. Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> in the CSF. Specific therapy with intravenous polymyxin E was started. Vancomycin was discontinued and meropenem continued while signs of meningitis in the form of elevated CSF cell count and CSF lactate and positive CSF microbiology persisted.</p><p>The decision was made to initiate therapeutic hypothermia for ICP control. The Thermogard XP temperature management system (Zoll, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, United States) was used with a heat-exchange catheter inserted into the right femoral vein. The target temperature range of 32.0 to 32.5&#x000b0;C was achieved in 3 hours. The ICP normalized from 25 to 35&#x02009;mm Hg to 10 to 15&#x02009;mm Hg over 1.5 hours. Attempts to rewarm the patient initially at 24- and then at 48-hour intervals after induction of hypothermia failed due to ICH recurrence. Therapeutic hypothermia was thus continued for a total of 7 days when a trial of rewarming was successful and after which the patient was fully rewarmed over 48 hours. Repeat CT scanning (<xref rid="FI140022-5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) showed patent basal cisterns, resolving pneumocephalus, and reduced brain edema. ICP remained stable at 7 to 15&#x02009;mm Hg, and the external ventricular drainage and ICP probe were removed. Mean MCA blood flow velocity reduced to 70 to 75 cm/second. CSF cell count decreased to 4/&#x000b5;L with correspondent reductions in lactate (4.4 mmol/L) and an increase in glucose to 5 mmol/L, and meropenem was discontinued. Mechanical ventilation was continued, and the patient was hemodynamically stable. A trial off sedation revealed a GCS of 10/15 (E1V4M5).</p><fig id="FI140022-5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>

During the initial 19 days, GCS was 12/15 (E1V5M6) after which time the patient opened his eyes spontaneously but was in a vegetative state that persisted for 33 days. Hydrocephalus developed, requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunting on the postoperative day 49. The patient gradually became able to follow simple, repeated commands, corresponding to a minimally conscious state. MRI revealed extensive white matter changes and findings consistent with resolved intracranial infection and the consequences of brain edema and herniation. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation unit in this condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The patient described here presented with pituitary apoplexy secondary to intratumoral hemorrhage in a pilocytic astrocytoma, a rare entity in this region; pituitary adenomas are a much more common finding.<xref rid="JR140022-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="JR140022-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal resection (ETTR) is now established as the approach of choice for tumors in this region, although postoperative meningitis is known to be an important and dangerous complication.<xref rid="JR140022-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="JR140022-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Risk factors for meningitis following ETTR include intra- and postoperative CSF leak and the attendant risks of external lumbar or ventricular drainage.<xref rid="JR140022-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The extent to which truly sterile surgery through the nasal cavity is possible is also debatable.

</p><p>In the situation described here, hypothermia remained the only second-tier therapy available due to the contraindications to other measures described earlier. The Thermogard XP system rapidly decreased core body temperature in our patient and allowed ICP to be kept below 20&#x02009;mm Hg. Despite this, our patient did not develop shivering or require additional sedation or paralysis.

</p><p>Our attempts to terminate hypothermia as soon as possible and to rewarm the patient at 24- and subsequently at 48-hour intervals were unsuccessful until day 7 of hypothermia due to immediate ICH recurrence, highlighting differences in the pathogenic mechanisms of cerebral edema after cardiac arrest and in ongoing meningitis. It is apparent that the mechanisms resulting in brain edema in patients with meningitis remain in effect for several days, whereas in post-arrest patients the influence of these factors recedes earlier. It is noteworthy that 7 days of catheter-mediated therapeutic hypothermia did not lead to any complications in this case. Seven days is the maximum advised duration of therapy as recommended by the manufacturers. To minimize complications, we used a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin throughout cooling and supplemented this with daily ultrasound examinations of the lower extremities, as well as careful aseptic technique on insertion of the catheter and meticulous care of the puncture site. It seems reasonable to suggest that hypothermia initiated for ICP control in patients secondary to meningitis should be continued for at least 72 hours, with this time period extended further if clinically warranted. The safety and efficacy of prolonged use of the Thermogard system is also supported by this case.</p><p>Sadly, the outcome in this case was less than optimal, with the patient discharged in a minimally conscious state. The risk of such unfavorable neurologic outcomes is always high in situations when first-tier therapy is ineffective and second-tier options are limited. The risk of such outcomes cannot be a contraindication for the use of hypothermia in such patients, although its judicious use should be discussed within the treating multidisciplinary team and with patients' families.</p><p>Experiences such as these mandate the exploration of further strategies combining hypothermia with other approaches to improve outcomes. Such combinations have been fruitful in studies of malignant stroke, where hypothermia combined with decompressive hemicraniectomy was proven effective.<xref rid="JR140022-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
