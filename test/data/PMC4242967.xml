affecting 0.1% of the general population. To date, few studies have investigated the
efficacy of physical therapy for SLE patients with CNS involvement. The aim of this study
was to report whether the combined use of corticosteroids and physical therapy, consisting
of reflex inhibition and functional training, was beneficial to functional recovery.
[Subjects and Methods] A 22-year-old male SLE patient with CNS involvement requested
physical therapy due to strong spasticity of the trunk and limbs in a bedridden state.
Corticosteroid intervention and physical therapy were undertaken for 16 days. [Result]
After 16 days of the interventions, the patient demonstrated stabilized and alleviated
neurological symptoms and an improved functional level. [Conclusion] The present case
indicates that physical therapy combined with corticosteroids might be a possible
treatment and rehabilitation method to effectively recover motor function for SLE patients
who have strong spasticity due to CNS involvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>Physical therapy</kwd><kwd>Systemic lupus erythematosus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with significant cerebrovascular and
neuropsychiatric diseases for which multiple pathogeneses have been proposed<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Involvement of the central nervous system
(CNS) is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in SLE patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the underlying mechanisms of the
CNS involvement are a less understood aspect of the disease, the common etiology is the
involvement of the cerebral microvasculature that causes deficits in motor functions shown
in the other diseases involving the CNS<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Cerebrovascular diseases in SLE have been estimated to occur in 5 to 19.6% of SLE
patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. SLE patients with CNS
involvement can demonstrate stroke-like symptoms such as severe hemiparesis, spasticity,
loss of soft tissue elasticity, etc<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Corticosteroid intervention has been considered the first-line treatment for
neuropsychiatric SLE<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies reported
that a corticosteroid treatment improved neurological symptoms by normalization of regional
cerebral blood flows for SLE patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no studies have been reported that
corticosteroid intervention led to reduced spasticity, improved balance and ADL for SLE
patients with CNS involvement. These facts indicate that although corticosteroid
intervention could be a major approach to promote relief of symptoms in SLE patients,
intervention has been limited to active and directive intervention to improve the motor
function of patients. Motor functions, such as reduced spasticity, balance, gait, and ADL,
in SLE are important because improvement of motor functions in patients leads to a better
quality of life.</p><p>Physical therapies have been a major treatment used to improve motor functions for patients
with CNS problems<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A main concept for
such physical therapy methods is developing inhibition of abnormal motor synergies to
decrease spasticity and improve motor control abilities in such patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. These signify that physical therapy treatments might play an
important role in improving decreased motor functions for SLE patients with CNS involvement.
However, based on our literature searches of PubMed<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Google
Scholar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, surprisingly, no studies have been reported about physical therapy
applied to SLE patients with CNS involvements.</p><p>In our study, we present a patient who was diagnosed as having SLE with CNS involvement. We
applied physical therapy as well as corticosteroid therapy to the patient and investigated
the clinical pathway. We conclude that these interventions can be effective treatments for
functional improvement of the patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>CASE REPORT</title><sec><title>Patient</title><p>A 22-year-old man with SLE was admitted to our physical therapy department, and he signed
an informed consent statement for this study. The patient presented with utterance of
meaningless words, jaundice, and lower limb weakness. He had been diagnosed with discoid
lupus erythematosus, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar affective
disorder five months prior to presentation. He reported a four-day history of epigastric
pain; four days before, there had been no other systemic features of infection.</p><p>He was diagnosed with SLE with CNS involvement and pericardial effusion. A radionuclide
regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) study with 900 MBq technetium-99&#x02005;m ethyl cysteinate
dimer (TECD) by single-positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed multifocal
decreased perfusion to the anterior cingulate, left parietal, left occipital, right
lateral temporal, and anterior pole of the left temporal cortices. Ultrasound revealed
that the liver, spleen, pancreas, and gall bladder were normal in size, contour,
echogenicity, wall thickness, and calcification. A hematological examination indicated
that his hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets were
normal. However, in a liver function test, his AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels were
markedly elevated. He was also positive for anti-dsDN, anti-histone, and anti-Sm
antibodies. Laboratory tests for venereal diseases and lupus anticoagulant tests were
negative. Electromyography showed no abnormal spontaneous activity, and his motor unit
potential was of normal amplitude and duration. He was treated with high-dose intravenous
steroids (methylprednisolone; 1&#x02005;g/day), which resulted in complete resolution of the SLE.
His neuropsychiatric symptoms were stationary.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical therapy</title><p>After admission for three days, he requested physical therapy due to marked spasticity
that was uncontrollable by corticosteroid intervention. His spasticity was similar to a
&#x0201c;bilateral stroke-like&#x0201d; symptom presented in his trunk and all four limbs. When admitted
to physical therapy on the day of the request, his spasticity level was modified Ashworth
scale (MAS) grade 3 in both lower limbs and grade 2 in both upper limbs. He had no active
range of motion activities in any limb. We could not evaluate his balance ability and ADL
level at the time of referral. His outcome measurements were evaluated at the time of
referral and at 5 days, 7 days, 12 days, and 16 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig.1.</label><caption><p>Schedule of treatment and assessment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1839-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Our first goal of the therapeutic treatment for the patient was spasticity relief, since
he had increased muscle tone that deteriorated motor function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). We used the reflex inhibition pattern (based on the Bobath
concept) to reduce the spasticity level<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reflex inhibition pattern could be described as particular
movement patterns of proximal joints that affect the tone of the trunk and limbs. The
applied reflex inhibition techniques to the patient consisted of passive and active ROM
exercises in all four limbs and the trunk in a normal sitting posture while the hip and
shoulder joints were flexed at 90 degrees. These techniques were applied for 1 hour a day
(5 days/week). After five days of treatment, his spasticity decreased to an MAS grade of 2
in the lower limbs and 1+ in the upper limbs. Of note, his ankle spasticity also
decreased. These outcomes suggest that spastic muscle groups were successfully inhibited
by the applied physical therapy techniques.</p><p>After seven days of reflex inhibition pattern treatment, his spasticity was no longer
apparent. We evaluated his balance ability with the Berg balance score (BBS), and his BBS
at this time was 15, indicating that the level of walking with assistance was not
achieved<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). He could maintain a sitting and standing posture with
minimal assistance from a physical therapist. For these reasons, we decided to focus the
physical therapy intervention on improvement of balance beginning with the intervention on
the 8th day of the physical therapy session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>). He was instructed to reach as far as possible in all cardinal directions in a
sitting posture in an unsupported chair and carry out active range of motion activities.
He was also asked to maintain a normal standing position on his own base of support. These
techniques were applied for 1 hour a day (5 days/week). After a week, he could perform the
sitting unsupported and partially perform the sitting to standing, standing to sitting,
and transfers items of the BBS. Twelve days after the request for physical therapy, his
BBS score reached 33 points, indicating the level of walking with assistance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>). We then set independent walking as his new goal and started gait training on
the 13th day of the physical therapy intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>).</p><p>After sixteen days, that is, on the last day of his physical therapy sessions, he could
walk without a cane. His BBS score also reached 47 points, indicating the level of
independent walking<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). The patient was discharged from physical
therapy and the hospital.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, corticosteroid and physical therapy interventions were applied to an SLE
patient with CNS involvement. At the time of referral, he showed no active motion and a high
level of spasticity in all four limbs. After 16 days of treatment, the patient demonstrated
stabilized and alleviated neurological symptoms and an improved functional level. Thus, the
current results indicate that the corticosteroid and physical therapy interventions applied
to the present patient effectively recovered his neurological symptoms and motor
functions.</p><p>Our first clinical goal was to reduce the patient&#x02019;s spasticity level because his high level
of spasticity inhibited normal movement patterns. Although the mechanisms underlying
spasticity have not been fully elucidated, prior works suggest that reflex inhibition and
decreased reciprocal inhibition of motor neurons may make an important contribution<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reflex and reciprocal inhibition techniques used in this study
might allow breakdown of the abnormal spinal stretch reflex mechanism and return of
appropriate muscle activity.</p><p>Another important reason to reduce the spasticity was that it is a starting point to
facilitate functional activities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
was the reason why balance and gait training were provided to the patient at the time when
spasticity was no longer apparent<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
results from the present case show that functional training seems to be successful in
recovering balance and gait abilities in a fast and effective manner, consistent with other
studies<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ultimately, he was discharged from the hospital with the ability
to walk independently after sixteen days of physical therapy sessions.</p><p>One of the limitations of the present case study is that it is unclear whether the
patient&#x02019;s spasticity and motor function recovery were primarily due to the corticosteroid
intervention or the physical therapy intervention. Based on previous studies, however, the
corticosteroid intervention was primarily administered to stabilize and alleviate the
patient&#x02019;s neurological symptoms<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and there was no
evidence of functional recovery. Although it is hard to differentiate the effects of the
corticosteroid and physical therapy interventions, we conclude that the two interventions
interplayed with each other to improve the patient&#x02019;s clinical status. Specifically, the
present impressive recovery in the patient&#x02019;s functional abilities resulted largely from the
physical therapy intervention, while the corticosteroid treatment had an effect on
stabilization and alleviation of the neurological symptoms. Further studies may be needed to
evaluate the possible differences between corticosteroid interventions and physical therapy
interventions in the treatment of SLE patients with CNS involvement.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Yonan</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharrar</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Middle cerebral artery resistivity and pulsatility indices
