In addition, the dynamic nature of accommodating IOLs may also impact refractive outcomes, depending on the baseline state of the IOL in the eye.</p><p>The dual-optic Synchrony accommodating IOL (Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, CA, USA) was specifically designed to fill the entire capsular bag and benefit from the accommodative capacity of the lens capsule during near vision.<xref rid="b3-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The three-dimensional, single-piece, foldable silicone lens has a high plus-powered moving optic attached to a variable minus-powered optic through spring haptics. A preloaded injector facilitates implantation through a small incision. The IOL is designed to provide a single, clear focus over a wide range of viewing distances through active accommodation. When implanted within the capsular bag, the capsular tension exerts a compressive force and decreases the interoptic separation of the IOL to a minimum. This compressed state is the emmetropic state of the IOL. With accommodative action, the zonules relax, releasing the tension on the capsular bag, which results in a forward displacement of the anterior optic. Design and clinical performance of the parent dual-optic accommodating IOL (Synchrony) have been discussed in detail in previous publications, including improved near vision, reading ability, and long-term performance.<xref rid="b4-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>A next generation, aspheric version of the dual-optic IOL (Synchrony Vu; Abbott Medical Optics Inc.) was developed to further mimic the optical changes in the eye during natural accommodation. During natural accommodation, the optical power of the crystalline lens increases along with an increase in negative spherical aberration.<xref rid="b8-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The central region of the natural lens exhibits greater change in optical power compared to more peripheral regions.<xref rid="b8-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The new generation dual-optic IOL is designed to mimic the spatially variant characteristics of natural accommodation and to further improve the near benefit provided by the dual-optic IOL. It incorporates a blended aspheric design with a central zone of negative spherical aberration smoothly transitioning into a spherical periphery. The purpose of this design is to achieve a selective increase in negative spherical aberration during near viewing associated with pupil constriction, while maintaining good optical quality during mesopic conditions with larger pupil diameter.</p><p>The objective of the current multicenter clinical study is to evaluate outcomes following primary implantation of this new aspheric dual-optic accommodating IOL for the visual correction of patients undergoing cataract extraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Clinical study design</title><p>A multicenter prospective study that included four sites and five investigators was undertaken. Prior approval by each institutional ethical committee was obtained, and all patients provided informed consent after an explanation of the nature of the study, including potential risks and benefits. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 148 eyes of 74 patients binocularly implanted with the Synchrony Vu IOL were followed up for a period of 6 months. The study was a feasibility study to evaluate the safety and visual performance of this new dual-optic accommodating IOL in a consecutive series of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>The IOL</title><p>Synchrony Vu (model SYNC-200) is a single-piece silicone IOL intended for use following cataract extraction. It comprises a dual-optic system arranged coaxially along the optical axis. The front optic diameter is 5.5 mm and the back optic diameter is 6 mm. The clear optic zone for both optics is 5 mm diameter. They are supported by 9.5 mm long haptic structures extending along opposite directions. Two posterior stabilizers extend laterally from the rear lens and are perpendicular to the direction of the haptic extension, with an overall length of 9.8 mm. In addition, the IOL has a small central aspheric zone (&#x0003c;2.5 mm diameter) in the center of the anterior lens. It is available in powers of 16&#x02013;28 D.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were age of at least 40 years at the time of surgery, bilateral age-related cataracts, preoperative corneal astigmatism of 1.5 diopters (D) or less, and requiring Synchrony Vu implantation within the available IOL powers. Preoperative exclusion criteria included history of prior ocular surgery or ocular pathology. Surgical exclusions included traumatic surgery; inability to achieve in-the-bag placement of the dual-optic IOL; irregular, decentered, or large (&#x0003e;5 mm diameter) continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC); and anterior or posterior capsule tear.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>Surgery was performed by five experienced surgeons in four sites using a standardized protocol. Phacoemulsification was performed in all eyes through a 5 mm (or smaller) CCC to achieve complete overlap of the anterior optic of the lens. The use of a corneal marker (Fujimoto CCC guide) was required to achieve a small anterior CCC sized under 5 mm diameter. IOL implantation was achieved with a preloaded injector designed to deliver the lens into the capsular bag through a 3.8 mm clear corneal incision. Surgeons performed meticulous anterior and posterior capsular bag cleanup to remove epithelial cells in an effort to retard capsular fibrosis. Standard postcataract surgery medications (0.5% moxifloxacin, 1% prednisolone acetate, and 0.5% ketorolac) were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Preoperative evaluation</title><p>All patients underwent standard preoperative assessments, including subjective refraction, intraocular pressure, and anterior and posterior segment evaluations. Preoperative biometry measurements, including keratometry, axial length, and anterior chamber depth measured with the IOLMaster 500 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany), were used to calculate the IOL power using a proprietary formula. The target refraction was always emmetropia.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative evaluation</title><p>Postoperative examinations were performed at 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 6-month time points after surgery. The 1-month and 6-month visits included measurements of uncorrected (U) visual acuity (VA) at 4 m (distance; UDVA), at 80 cm (intermediate; UIVA), and at 40 cm (near; UNVA) as well as manifest refraction, distance-corrected VA at distance (CDVA), intermediate (DCIVA), and near (DCNVA). Monocular VAs were obtained at all visits, and binocular VAs were obtained at 6 months. Patients requiring refractive correction were prescribed glasses 6&#x02013;8 weeks after the second eye surgery. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts under photopic light levels were used for VA measurements.</p><p>Subjective questionnaires evaluated spectacle use (options included never, near only, far only, both far and near), frequency of spectacle wear (never, occasionally, most of the time, always) separately for near, intermediate, and far distances, and symptoms of glare, halo, and double vision on a 5-point scale. Additionally, the ease of performing activities (such as reading a magazine, reading a book, reading medicine labels, playing cards, using computer, using cell phone, and driving car) was evaluated on a 7-point scale, which included an option of not applicable if the task was not commonly performed by the patient. The questionnaires were administered at the 6-month time point.</p><p>In a subset of 40 patients (80 eyes) in three sites, monocular contrast sensitivity was measured with the OPTEC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 6500 with the functional acuity contrast test (FACT) charts (Stereo Optical Co., Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) at 6 months after surgery. Two conditions, with and without a glare source, were tested under mesopic light levels (3 cd/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab (Minitab version 16; PA, USA).

DCIVAs and DCNVAs can be considered a measure of the accommodative or depth of focus performance of the lens.

The UDVA for all the three eyes was 20/20; however, the patients did complain of glare symptoms. All three eyes were monitored throughout the duration of the study without any surgical intervention.</p><p>In one eye, the IOL was repositioned within 1 month of surgery due to a partial anterior prolapse of the anterior optic from the capsular bag. The IOL was stable in the bag following repositioning, and at the 6-month visit the patient had a UDVA of 20/32 and CDVA of 20/20.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the new Synchrony Vu aspheric IOL, a multicenter clinical trial was undertaken. The clinical trial was primarily a feasibility study to evaluate the performance of this new IOL. The lack of a control group can be considered a drawback of the study design, and future studies may be performed with adequate control groups, although the study is strengthened with the use of standardized testing procedures across multiple sites. It was found that following an initial period of myopia, average refractive error close to emmetropia was achieved by the 6-month time point. UDVA largely stabilized by 1 month. It should be noted that all patients were targeted for emmetropia and no intentional monovi-sion was attempted. The initial myopia may be explained by the dual-optics of the Synchrony Vu IOL, designed to allow forward movements of the front optic. The IOL relies on capsular bag forces to maintain the two optics in a compressed state, with a 0.5 mm separation between the optics for emmetropia. Any forward movement of the front optic will lead to accommodation or, in other words, myopic refractive error. It is likely that in the initial postoperative period, the two optics were separated by greater than 0.5 mm and gradually compressed as the capsular bag underwent postoperative changes and adapted to the IOL. In general, patients achieved good UDVAs both monocularly (20/25) and binocularly (20/20) by 6 months.</p><p>IVAs were similar to distance vision (ie, 20/25 monocularly and 20/20 binocularly) with or without distance refractive correction. Similarly, near vision was, on average, 20/40 monocularly and 20/25 binocularly with or without distance refractive correction. It is important to note that distance refractive correction did not reduce intermediate and near visual performance, as might be expected with any monovision strategy.</p><p>As a measure of functional performance, it was observed that 80%&#x02013;90% of the patients achieved a combination of 20/25 VA at distance and intermediate and 20/40 VA at near (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-8-2289">Figure 1</xref>). If one considers typical newspaper print to be about 20/50,<xref rid="b11-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> then these patients can be considered spectacle-free for most day-to-day visual tasks. This is supported by survey data showing 78% of patients not requiring spectacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-8-2289">Figure 2</xref>). When evaluating ease of performing various tasks, in general the tasks were rated to be easy to moderate, including reading a medicine bottle label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-8-2289">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The safety profile of a dual-optic IOL may be expected to be different from a single-optic IOL. It is possible that a dual-optic IOL could experience greater tilt or decentration than a single-optic IOL. The haptic design of an accommodating IOL should be capable of allowing dynamic movements of the IOL as opposed to a single-optic IOL designed for good stability within the capsular bag. Three eyes in the current study were noted to have IOL decentration, with subjective glare symptoms, even though 20/20 VA was achieved in each case. Directed survey on glare, halo, and double vision indicated generally few symptoms. About 30% of the patients experienced some degree of glare, and 20% experienced some degree of halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-opth-8-2289">Figure 4</xref>), which is currently better than that reported for multifocal IOLs (up to 70%).<xref rid="b12-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>As further evidence of good imaging quality, mesopic contrast sensitivity with or without glare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-opth-8-2289">Figure 5</xref>) was within normal limits.<xref rid="b10-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b14-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The current clinical study did not include objective accommodation testing because it was designed as a feasibility study with clinically viable test methods. Future studies with Synchrony Vu IOL should consider further optical characterization, objective accommodation testing, and an appropriate control group.</p><p>Current options to correct presbyopia during cataract surgery include monovision, multifocal IOLs, and accommodating IOLs. Compared to monovision, multifocal and accommodating IOLs have the potential to maintain binocular function at all distances. The main limitations of multifocal IOLs are the high incidence of dysphotopic phenomena such as glare and halos,<xref rid="b15-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the loss of contrast inherent to a design that causes loss of incident light to higher orders of aberration.<xref rid="b17-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Single-optic accommodating IOLs have in common somewhat limited amplitude of accommodation,<xref rid="b18-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and often provide inadequate or inconsistent near vision. Quality of vision has also been a challenge with single-optic accommodating lenses.<xref rid="b19-opth-8-2289" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These difficulties led to the development of the dual-optic accommodating IOL in an attempt to provide adequate levels of spectacle independence while maintaining good image quality. The current study showed that overall good visual outcomes can be expected with the Synchrony Vu IOL at intermediate and near distances with or without distance refractive correction.</p><p>In conclusion, an aspheric version of the dual-optic accommodating IOL (Synchrony Vu) was evaluated in a multicenter clinical trial to show good functional visual performance at a range of distances with minimal visual side effects. The safety profile of an accommodating IOL, especially a dual-optic IOL, is expected to be different from a nonaccommodating single-optic IOL and should be considered together with the benefit.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Ricardo Alarcon, MD, and Victor Bohorquez, MD (Department of Ophthalmology, ServiOftalmos, Bogota, Colombia); Ivan Ossma, MD (Fundaci&#x000f3;n Valle de Lili, Cali, Colombia); Cristina Peris-Martinez, MD, PhD (Fundaci&#x000f3;n Oftalmol&#x000f3;gica del Mediterr&#x000e1;neo, Valencia, Spain) for help in data collection.
