Based on reactivity with the externally accessible endogenous cysteine C106 in S1, we infer that each of the above S4 cysteine mutants forms Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridges to stabilize a channel closed state. Disulfide bonds and metal bridges constrain the S4 residues S195, R198, and R201 near C106 in S1 in the resting state, and experiments using concatenated tetrameric constructs indicate that this occurs within the same VSD. KCNQ2 structural models suggest that three distinct resting channel states have been captured by the formation of different S4&#x02013;S1 Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridges. Collectively, this work reveals that residue C106 in S1 can be very close to several N-terminal S4 residues for stabilizing different KCNQ2 resting conformations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>KCNQ channels (Kv7) comprise a subfamily of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels that play important functions in different tissues including various epithelia, smooth muscle, brain, and heart (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Maljevic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Peroz et al., 2008</xref>). In the brain, the KCNQ2 subunit coassembles with KCNQ3 to generate the I<sub>M</sub> current, a slowly activating, noninactivating Kv current. The I<sub>M</sub> current has profound effects on neuronal excitability, as its low threshold gating and slow activation act as a brake for repetitive firing (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>). In humans, mutations in KCNQ2 are associated with benign neonatal forms of epilepsy or with severe epileptic encephalopathy (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Maljevic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Soldovieri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Weckhuysen et al., 2012</xref>). Like in all Kv channels, KCNQ2 &#x003b1; subunits possess two transmembrane modules: a pore-lining region and a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). VSDs are endowed with charged amino acids, also called gating charges. It is commonly recognized that four highly conserved arginine residues along S4 (R1, R2, R3, and R4) mainly contribute to the voltage-driven gating charge transfer during channel activation, which could be measured as gating currents (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yellen, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Swartz, 2004</xref>). The gating charges reside in aqueous crevices and translocate across a focused electric field, where hydrophobic residues form a plug that occludes the &#x0201c;gating pore&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>). Along this narrow path, the positive charges in S4 are stabilized by electrostatic interactions with negative countercharges in segments S2 and S3, water dipoles in the crevices, and negatively charged phospholipids (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). Crystallographic studies of Kv1.2 channels and bacterial Na<sub>v</sub>Ab voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels have described the VSD architecture in its activated conformation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>). It is a module of four membrane-spanning segments (S1&#x02013;S4), which moves at the protein&#x02013;lipid interface (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Swartz, 2008</xref>). A portion of the S4 segment adopts a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix conformation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>). Although the activated conformation of the VSD was elucidated from the crystal structures of different K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>), its topology in the resting state has not yet been determined at atomic resolution and remains highly debated. Voltage-clamp fluorometry, cysteine cross-linking, and metal bridge experimental constraints were extensively used in the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel to predict the VSD resting-state conformation of Kv channels (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Catterall, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>; see also, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Henrion et al., 2012</xref>). However, very few studies have addressed this issue in other Kv channels (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, cysteine mutations S195C, R198C, and R201C were introduced into the S4 segment of the KCNQ2 channel. This approach was taken to potentially form metal bridges or covalent disulfide bonds with an endogenous cysteine in S1, upon external application of Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions or copper phenanthroline (Cu-Phen), respectively. Electrophysiological experiments disclose the formation of three discrete S4&#x02013;S1 Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridges whose structural models infer the existence of three distinct KCNQ2 channel resting states.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Constructs and mutagenesis</title><p>For expression in mammalian cells, KCNQ2 WT (provided by T.

Site-directed mutagenesis was generated by PCR amplification using complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides (Hylabs) and Pfu polymerase (Promega). Mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, WT KCNQ2 was inserted into the PTLN vector, which was linearized by Mlu1. Capped complementary RNAs (cRNAs) were transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega) and quantified by UV spectrophotometry (Nanodrop), and their integrity was verified on formaldehyde agarose gels. The WT KCNQ2 concatenated tetrameric construct was built into the pGEM vector using the same strategy described for KCNQ1 tetramers (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Meisel et al., 2012</xref>), where subunits D1, D2, D3, and D4 were connected by flexible linkers of eight glycines, each harboring unique restriction sites BamHI, EcoRI, and EcoRV, respectively. The concatenated construct was confined by HindIII and XbaI restriction sites upstream and downstream, respectively. Using this cassette, each subunit could be removed and mutated separately by cut and paste with a pair of restriction enzymes. For example, the D1 subunit could be cut and pasted using HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes. The concatenated KCNQ2 was then inserted into the pcDNA3 vector to allow expression in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures, transfection, and Western blotting</title><p>Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

To this end, the sequence extending from A92 to H324 was submitted for searching a homologous template in the SWISS-MODEL repository, a database for theoretical protein models. The search for homologous sequences of known 3-D structures scored three known atomic resolution structures as potential templates, as follows. (1) The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the KcsA K<sup>+</sup> channel (Protein Data Bank [PDB] accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2K1E">2K1E</ext-link>; chain B; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2008</xref>), which shares 37% sequence identity with residues 245&#x02013;324 of KCNQ2. (2) The x-ray crystal structure of the Kv1.2 K<sup>+</sup> channel (PDB accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2A79">2A79</ext-link>; chain B; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2005</xref>), which shares 26% sequence identity with residues 166&#x02013;324 of KCNQ2. (3) The x-ray crystal structure of the Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 chimeric K<sup>+</sup> channel (PDB accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>; chain H; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>), which shares 22% sequence identity with residues 93&#x02013;323 of KCNQ2. Among the three potential templates, the search scored 2r9rH with the lowest E-value (1.1E-44 compared with 4.5E-21 and 1.1E-36 for 2k1eB and 2a79B, respectively). Therefore, an initial model was built on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure of the Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 chimeric K<sup>+</sup> channel, and was used as a starting point for building model structures for the resting states. 3-D alignment of the KCNQ2 homology model with the Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 x-ray crystal structure showed root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.17 &#x000c5; for 214 C&#x003b1; atoms of the amino acids underlined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.201411221/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S5</ext-link>. The single-chain 3-D alignment was used to oligomerize four modeled chains around the axis of fourfold symmetry of Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 to get a tetrameric open-state KCNQ homology model. We then rigidly pivoted the lower half of the S6 segments around their hinges at the level of P308 so as to eliminate lateral openings between adjacent S6 segments along the lower half of the open pore surface (at the level of A309 and G310) and to optimize the van der Waals interactions between adjacent S6 segments. Note that this rigid body movement caused &#x0223c;1.7-&#x000c5; deviation at the level of the Gln323-C&#x003b1; atom, with zero deviation at the level of the L307-C&#x003b1; atom. We further optimized the model to eliminate steric clashes at the intersubunit interfaces by choosing nonclashing rotamers with COOT (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and performing energy minimization in vacuo to the entire tetrameric model structure using GROMOS96.</p><p>To derive the C3 (deep), C2 (intermediate), and C1 (superficial) closed (resting) states, three structural elements of chain A of the open-state model structure were modified. These are the VSD, the S4&#x02013;S5 linker, and the S6 segment. In the VSD, a portion of the S4 segment was found to adopt a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix conformation in the x-ray structures of the resting state of the MlotiK1 CNG channel, the active/relaxed state of the Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 chimeric K<sup>+</sup> channel, and the preopen state of the NavAb Na<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, similar to the approach taken by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Henrion et al. (2012)</xref> for a <italic>Shaker</italic> channel, we introduced a nearly constant length of 3<sub>10</sub>-helix conformation &#x0201c;sliding&#x0201d; along the S4 segment across all KCNQ2-state models, which allows for rotation of the S4 outer end only, without net free energy cost. In the resting C3, C2, C1, and open O states, the 3<sub>10</sub> helix spans KCNQ2 residues 197&#x02013;203, 201&#x02013;207, 203&#x02013;213, and 205&#x02013;214, respectively (Fig. S5 B). For modeling the VSDs, S195, R198, or R210 were mutated in silico to a cysteine residue in C3, C2, or C1, respectively. To bring C195, C198, and C201 of each model sufficiently close to form a reversible Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridge with C106 in S1 (center-to-center distance of 4.5&#x02013;6.0 &#x000c5; between the sulfur atoms), the S4 segment of chain A was translated downward (toward the intracellular side), similarly to what has been performed for the hypothetical closed-channel model of the Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 chimeric K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>). Together with the downward translation, the S4 segment was rotated counterclockwise. In each model, this downward movement was further constrained by keeping the side chains of the residues carrying the gating charges in a distance that would allow the formation of salt bridges or hydrogen bonds with counterpart glutamate residues in S2. These pairs are: for C3, R198-E130 and R201-E140; for C2, R201-E130 and Q204-E140; for C1, Q204-E130 and R207-E140. This process resulted in the distances provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref> and placed the C terminus of S4 in different topological levels: the lowest (deepest) position for C3, the highest (superficial) position for C1, and an intermediate position for C2. To connect the S4&#x02013;S5 helical linker to S4 in the C3, C2, and C1 models, the linker was rigidly pivoted around the kink at its borderline with S5 (His228, Ser229), downward and toward the fourfold axis of symmetry. Concomitantly, the lower half of S6 was rigidly pivoted around P308 downward and toward the axis of fourfold symmetry, while maintaining the multiple van der Waals interactions of the S4&#x02013;S5 helical linker with residues in the lower half of the S6 segment. Note that the shape of S6 in the closed states (segment W288&#x02013;E322) turned out to be very similar (although not identical) to that of KcsA (PDB accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="1BL8">1BL8</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Before the oligomerization process, the single-chain models were subjected to validation in the RCSB PDB Validation Server under &#x0201c;Option 1&#x0201d; to run geometric checks outside of the deposition pipeline and to find violations in terms of close contacts, bond deviations, and covalent bond distances and angles. Subsequently, clashes have been eliminated by choosing low energy side-chain conformations using COOT, whereas other violations have been minimized by using COOT in combination with segmental in vacuo energy minimization with GROMOS96. Note that this process was also performed for chain A of the open-state model. To create tetrameric model structures for the closed states, chain A of each model was oligomerized around the axis of fourfold symmetry. To this end, the fold of the T234-F304 sequence of four A chains was superimposed, one at the time, on the same fold of the four chains of the open-state model structure (RMSD for the 284 backbone atoms is 0). A few clashes at the intersubunit interfaces were relieved by choosing low energy side-chain conformations.</p><p>All four final tetrameric models were subjected to geometry validation by SFCHECK at the RCSB PDB Validation Server under &#x0201c;Option 2.&#x0201d; No issues have been found in terms of atomic clashes, peptide linkage, covalent geometry, chirality errors, and Phi/Psi torsion angles.</p><p>Notably, the Voronoi diagrams generated for the pore molecular surface of the three closed-state model structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A&#x02013;C</xref>) indicate that the models&#x02019; water-filled cavities share similar shape and dimensions, with a maximum diameter of &#x0223c;10 &#x000c5; (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pet&#x00159;ek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Berka et al., 2012</xref>). This is also the diameter of the water-filled cavity in the open-channel model, but in this case, the water-filled cavity extends toward the intracellular side because of the concerted swinging of the lower half of the S6 segments away from the axis of fourfold symmetry. It should be noted that, below the water-filled cavity, the pore&#x02019;s molecular surface of the closed states greatly differs from that of the KcsA K<sup>+</sup> channel because of sequence dissimilarities and slightly different angle relatively to the axis of fourfold symmetry. In the KCNQ2 closed-state models, A309, G310, G313, and S314 line the pore between the water-filled cavity and the activation gate (A317). The homologous positions in KcsA are equipped with bulkier side chains (see Fig. S5 C). Hence, at these positions in KcsA (particularly T107 and A111), the pore looks much narrower than in the closed-state models whose pore lining at that region adopts an inverted cone shape.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>The online supplemental material contains five figures.

The WT KCNQ2 subunit has 16 endogenous cysteines, but only two are accessible from the external milieu and can potentially engage into metal bridge formation. These are C106 in S1, which is conserved in all KCNQ channel subtypes, and C242 in S5, which is exclusively present in KCNQ2. We initially introduced single cysteine mutations into segment S4 of the KCNQ2 subunit and compared the propensity of WT and mutant KCNQ2 channels to form metal bridges after the external application of 100 &#x000b5;M Cd<sup>2+</sup>. To this end, channels were expressed in CHO cells, and currents were recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique.</p><p>WT KCNQ2 displayed no significant differences in V<sub>50</sub> or current amplitude after the external application of 100 &#x000b5;M Cd<sup>2+</sup> (CdCl<sub>2</sub>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.201411221/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C</ext-link>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) or 100 &#x000b5;M DTT (Fig. S1, D&#x02013;F). A slight decrease in current amplitude was observed even after washout, which probably reflects minor current rundown caused by a decrease in membranous PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that none of the endogenous cysteine in WT KCNQ2 is able to form a metal bridge under these experimental conditions, or alternatively, if any bridge is formed, it does not affect channel function.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Effects of Cd<sup>2+</sup> on the amplitude and voltage dependence of the various homomeric and heteromeric channels</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Channel</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V<sub>50</sub></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V<sub>50Cd</sub></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I<sub>Cd</sub><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">a</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>mV</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>mV</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT Q2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;20.0 &#x000b1;

Alternatively, Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions may be coordinated in the open-state conformation and subsequently cause the channel to close. To determine the state dependence of metal bridge formation, we incubated the cells for 5 min with Cd<sup>2+</sup> at &#x02212;90 mV, a voltage at which the channel is closed, and then we checked the current amplitude at the first depolarizing pulse to 30 mV.

Alternatively, if Cd<sup>2+</sup> coordination occurs in the open-state conformation, we expect to see no change in current amplitude at the first depolarizing pulse compared with the control current, and eventually a strong decrease of the current amplitude after subsequent depolarization.

Most of the experimental and modeling studies were performed in <italic>Shaker</italic> channels and to a lesser extent in Kv1.2 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>); however, attempts to predict the VSD resting state in other Kv channels are very limited (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Haitin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van Horn et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we aimed to address this issue in KCNQ2 channels. Structural homology models of KCNQ1 in the closed-state conformation were developed previously (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van Horn et al., 2011</xref>). However, initial attempts to derive a resting-state model of KCNQ2, based on the previously published model of KCNQ1, failed because it did not fit with all of our experimental constraints (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van Horn et al., 2011</xref>). This is probably because KCNQ channels display more than one closed state. To overcome this limitation, three distinct closed-state models of KCNQ2 were constructed by applying each of our Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridge constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8, A&#x02013;F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9, A&#x02013;C</xref>). These closed-state models were built by using the crystal structure of the open/relaxed state of the Kv1.2&#x02013;Kv2.1 chimera (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>) as a starting point, and by making the following assumptions: (a) The topologies of S4 and S1 in the models are constrained by our experimental data, such that each closed state&#x02014;C195, C198, or C201 in S4&#x02014;is in atomic proximity to C106 in S1. (b) The S4&#x02013;S5 linker was kept in contact with the C terminus of the S6 segment, such that the intracellular gate remained closed. (c) The S1 and S2 segments do not move during the closed to open transition. (d) The atomic distance between two sulfhydryls was constrained to roughly 5&#x02013;6 &#x000c5; to enable bridging by Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions, in accordance with the metalloprotein database (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Castagnetto et al., 2002</xref>). (e) The S4 segment adopts combined &#x003b1;-helical and 3<sub>10</sub>-helix conformations, as indicated by available crystal structures and different modeling studies (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bjelkmar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Khalili-Araghi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><sec><title>KCNQ2 model of the open state O</title><p>In the open-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 D</xref>), the 3<sub>10</sub> helix extends from I205 to R214 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8 G</xref> and S5 B).

All resting-state models posit that S4 undergoes a rotation and an inward translation along its main axis relatively to the VSD-activated conformation in crystal structures, whereas the S1 and S2 helices do not move during the closed to open transition (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This view supports a sliding helix model of the voltage-dependent gating in which the gating-charged arginines in S4 are suggested to sequentially form ion pairs with negatively charged residues in S2&#x02013;S3 segments during activation of the channel. The models also incorporate the existence of multiple resting states, which are supported by a wide range of experimental data (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">DeCaen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Henrion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lacroix et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our empirical constraints support the existence of multiple KCNQ2 closed states, where the formation of discrete S4&#x02013;S1 Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridges capture at least three distinct KCNQ2 resting states: C3, C2, and C1. The KCNQ2 deep resting state C3 model is analogous to the C3 closed state recently described for <italic>Shaker</italic> channels (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Henrion et al., 2012</xref>), where like in KCNQ2, the S4&#x02013;S2 interacting pairs R362-E283 and R365-E293 are found above and below the homologous phenylalanine F290, respectively. The importance of the Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridge formed by C195 in S4 and C106 in S1, which traps the VSD in C3, is underscored by recent models developed for the bacterial voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel NaChBac (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">DeCaen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>). In NaChBac, the outermost S4 residue T110 (also called T0; analogous to S195 in KCNQ2) interacts with E43 at the extracellular end of S1 to stabilize a deep closed state. Although not identical, the deep resting state C3 of KCNQ2 resembles that of resting state C1 described for NaChBac (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>). The KCNQ2 resting-state C2 model shares some similarities with the C2 closed state described by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Henrion et al. (2012)</xref> for <italic>Shaker</italic> channels. However, there are substantial differences between KCNQ2 and <italic>Shaker</italic>. In the C2 closed state of the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel, the S4&#x02013;S2 interacting pairs R365-E283 and R368-E293 form salt bridges. In contrast, in KCNQ2, the homologous residue of R368 in S4 is a glutamine, Q204, which cannot engage into salt bridge with E140 in S2 (E293 in <italic>Shaker</italic>), but probably forms a hydrogen bond with E140. Notably, the experimental data clearly indicate that the ion pair R201-E130 is much more critical for stabilizing a closed-channel conformation than the ion pair R198-E130 because, unlike the R198C mutant, the R201C mutation yields constitutively open channels. The C1 models of KCNQ2 and the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel differ in terms of ion pairing. Although the <italic>Shaker</italic> C1 model assumes two ion pairs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Henrion et al., 2012</xref>), in KCNQ2 there is only one ion pairing (R207-E140) and a potential Q204-E130 hydrogen bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>). Interestingly, in silico replacement of C201 by an arginine in model C1 suggests that R201 can potentially interact with E130 also in the superficial C1 resting state (and not only in the intermediate C2 resting state). This possibility may explain the critical role of R201 in stabilizing WT KCNQ channels in a superficial C1 resting state.</p><p>Collectively, this study reveals that residue C106 in S1 can be very close to several N-terminal S4 residues (S195, R198, R201) for stabilizing different KCNQ2 resting states. This is in line with previous studies performed in <italic>Shaker</italic> channels showing that the analogous S1 position I241 constrains the resting state of S4 with respect to S1 by interacting with R362 (analogous to R198 in KCNQ2) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al., 2007</xref>). A more recent work also disclosed the importance of this residue for both the VSD movement and its coupling to the pore domain, as mutant I241W could trap the VSD in an intermediate state (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2012</xref>). Our data confirm the importance of residue R201 (R2) in stabilizing the resting state of KCNQ2 by engaging into ion pairing with E130 in S2 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Miceli et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, this work shows that despite certain differences, the KCNQ2 resting-state models meet with the emerging consensual VSD resting-state models of Kv channels.</p></sec></sec>
