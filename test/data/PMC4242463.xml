Here we genotype 2,296 samples from two isolated Greek populations, the Pomak villages (HELIC-Pomak) in the North of Greece and the Mylopotamos villages (HELIC-MANOLIS) in Crete. We compare their genomic characteristics to the general Greek population and establish them as genetic isolates. In the MANOLIS cohort, we observe an enrichment of missense variants among the variants that have drifted up in frequency by more than fivefold. In the Pomak cohort, we find novel associations at variants on chr11p15.4 showing large allele frequency increases (from 0.2% in the general Greek population to 4.6% in the isolate) with haematological traits, for example, with mean corpuscular volume (rs7116019, <italic>P</italic>=2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;26</sup>). We replicate this association in a second set of Pomak samples (combined <italic>P</italic>=2.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;36</sup>). We demonstrate significant power gains in detecting medical trait associations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Population isolates have key features that can be used in disease mapping such as reduced environmental, phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Isolated populations are usually contained within a region because of geographical and/or cultural barriers that often coincide with a homogeneous set of environmental exposures, for example, diet and lifestyle. The founding event and the limited or absent gene migration with neighbouring populations give rise to a small effective population size (Ne), which is maintained over time and results in increased levels of homozygosity and linkage disequilibrium (LD). The genetic architecture of isolates can be further influenced by population bottlenecks that decrease population size. Under these circumstances, genetic drift can lead to significant reduction of extant genetic variability and drift potentially trait-associated alleles to higher frequency.</p><p>Under the auspices of the HELlenic Isolated Cohorts study (HELIC), we have collected samples from two isolated populations in Greece: the Pomak villages (HELIC-Pomak), a set of religiously isolated mountainous villages in the North of Greece, and the Mylopotamos mountainous villages (HELIC-MANOLIS) on the island of Crete. All samples have information on anthropometric, cardiometabolic, biochemical, haematological and diet-related traits and both cohorts form the substrate for medically relevant trait association studies.</p><p>The HELIC-MANOLIS (Minoan isolates) collection comprises individuals from the mountainous Mylopotamos villages, including Anogia, Zoniana, Livadia and Gonies (estimated population size of 6,000 in total). Residents of the Mylopotamos villages have over the centuries preserved their customs, traditions and anthropological character. The Pomaks inhabit the regional units of Xanthi, Rhodope and Evros. The HELIC-Pomak collection comprises individuals from the Pomak villages located in the regional unit of Xanthi (estimated to be 25,000 in total). The Pomaks represent a small minority of Muslims in Greece with uncertain historical origins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The two most dominant theories state that the Pomaks are either descendants of natives of the Rhodope mountains (on the border of Bulgaria and Greece<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> or have come from Asia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The Pomak language is thought to be either a Bulgarian or a Slavic dialect; however, today most Pomaks are also fluent in Turkish and Greek. After World War II and through the end of 1995, most Pomaks lived in a military-restricted zone, access to which required special permission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>The aims of our study are twofold. First, we use genome-wide genotype data to genetically characterize the MANOLIS and Pomak cohorts and compare their allelic architecture to the general Greek population; we demonstrate that isolation caused extensive genetic drift in both isolates. Second, we evaluate the gains in power for complex trait mapping studies that can be afforded by studying well-characterized population isolates in two ways: we calculate power to detect loci that have drifted up in frequency in the isolates compared with the general Greek population highlighting significant theoretical gains in power for variants at the lower end of the minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum. We then demonstrate this empirically by examining the biological role of these variants and their association with medically important complex traits. We find an enrichment of missense variants among alleles that have drifted up in frequency in the MANOLIS cohort and novel associations between haematological traits and alleles that have drifted up in frequency in the Pomak cohort.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Population genetics</title><p>To characterize the isolates in the context of broader global diversity, we applied multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses including data from the general Greek population and from the 1000 Genomes Project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. As expected, the two isolates formed well-defined clusters proximal to the general Greek population (TEENAGE), the Utah Residents with Northern and Western European Ancestry (CEU) and the Toscani in Italia (TSI) population clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We also observed a distinctive pattern of the two population isolates clustering on either side of the general Greek population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This is consistent with the results of population differentiation assessed via pairwise Fst calculations that support higher, albeit still small, genetic differentiation between the isolates (Fst for MANOLIS versus Pomak=0.005) than between each isolate and the general population (Fst for MANOLIS versus TEENAGE=0.002 and Fst for Pomak versus TEENAGE=0.003; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). MDS analysis at this resolution reveals some intrapopulation structure for the Pomak population where individuals from one particular village (Kentavros) tend to form a distinct cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Since Kentavros is the largest village population in the Pomak cohort and population structure analyses can be strongly influenced by uneven sampling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we repeated the MDS analysis by randomly selecting <italic>N</italic>=61 individuals from Kentavros, which is comparable to the size of other large villages; we observe that the subsampled Kentavros individuals do not form a distinct cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Levels of isolatedness</title><p>The inbreeding coefficient (Fin) was higher in the Pomak and MANOLIS populations compared with TEENAGE (0.014, 0.007 and 0.0004, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Similarly, genome-wide homozygosity (Fhom) was elevated in the Pomak and MANOLIS populations compared with TEENAGE (0.643&#x000b1;0.006, 0.639&#x000b1;0.004 and 0.635&#x000b1;0.002, respectively), with the Pomak population showing higher variance in inbreeding than MANOLIS and TEENAGE, in which a tighter distribution is observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these observations, genomic runs of homozygosity (ROH) show that the two isolated populations have on average a much larger number (nROH) and length (cROH) of ROH than TEENAGE. The Pomak isolate displays higher ROH values with respect to the MANOLIS isolate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). When using a different definition of calling ROH based on LD-pruned data, we observe a larger relative difference in nROH and cROH in the two isolates compared with TEENAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This is expected, given that the ROH detected using the latter approach are likely to be because of recent parental relatedness rather than ancient patterns of shared ancestry.</p><p>We computed for each population the proportion of individuals that have at least one &#x02018;surrogate parent&#x02019; for randomly chosen regions in the genome of varying length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. This concept was coined by Kong <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and refers to individuals from the same population who share local haplotypes with the index individual; these can be used to phase the index individual genotypes as though they are actual parents. Our results for randomly chosen regions across the genome are qualitatively similar. For example, for a region on 15q25 (781 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) we observe that with as little as 300 individuals analysed per population 88% of Pomak individuals and 79% of MANOLIS individuals have at least one &#x02018;surrogate parent&#x02019; compared with 6% in the general Greek population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Using the modified long-range phasing (LRP) method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>) we find a much greater extent of haplotype sharing in the isolated populations, with the median length of haplotypes being 1.78, 1.42 and 1.07&#x02009;cM in the Pomak, MANOLIS and TEENAGE cohorts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Consequently, 50% of randomly sampled locations within the genome lie in shared haplotype lengths of at least 12.4, 12.5 and 1.3&#x02009;cM, respectively (N50 haplotype length; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of shared haplotype lengths in the isolates is bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), with peaks corresponding to very recent co-ancestry (within the last few generations) and much older co-ancestry (as in the TEENAGE population). Since only unrelated samples have been used in this analysis, it is likely that this difference reflects co-ancestry dating prior and subsequent to the population founding event, respectively.</p><p>The extent of isolation of the Pomak and MANOLIS samples is further reflected in the fact that nearest neighbours (NNs), that is, genealogically closest individuals in the sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>), are typically chosen from within their cohort: 88.3% and 90.5%, respectively, versus 48.5% for the TEENAGE samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). While ~10% of the isolates have NNs from the TEENAGE cohort, the shared haplotype chunks specific to these NNs are significantly shorter, fourfold and threefold for the Pomak and MANOLIS cohorts, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that typically the inferred co-ancestry pre-dates the isolation events. The limited number of larger haplotype chunks (0.5% of chunks in the Pomak cohort copied from TEENAGE are &#x0003e;5&#x02009;cM, 1% for MANOLIS; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) is indicative of very limited migration and gene flow events.</p><p>To estimate the age of co-ancestry, we fit a model of exponential decay of haplotype sharing around 100 randomly sampled locations across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). We find that the median age of common ancestors is 8.56 and 8.65 generations in Pomak and MANOLIS, respectively, but 89.7 generations in TEENAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), which is comparable to that observed in other European populations. Using a simple moment estimator, these values imply recent effective population sizes of 2,400, 3,200 and 32,000 for the three populations, respectively. In short, the rate of genetic drift in the isolated populations is ~10 times that in the TEENAGE population.</p><p>Using a different approach that utilizes pairwise LD information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we observe a qualitatively similar result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). By examining trends of effective population size through time, we observe a recent expansion in TEENAGE as observed in general European populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, whereas the two isolates show a reduction in effective population size, a sign that they experienced a strong genetic drift, as observed in other European isolated populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genetic drift</title><p>Overall, the MANOLIS, Pomak and TEENAGE cohorts have similar allele frequency distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We calculated absolute allele frequency differences by comparing the allele frequencies of all variants in each of the two isolates against their respective allele frequency in the general Greek population. Compared with the general Greek population, we find that 49.74% (324,689) and 48.59% (311,922) of variants examined genome wide have increased in frequency in MANOLIS and Pomak, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In all, 50.03% (326,623) and 51.19% (328,629) of variants examined genome wide have decreased in frequency in MANOLIS and Pomak, respectively, and 0.23% of variants in each isolate showed no allele frequency change with respect to TEENAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p>In the respective fold analyses, 517 (0.08%) variants displayed &#x0003e;10-fold increase in MANOLIS versus TEENAGE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The highest fold difference in MANOLIS versus TEENAGE was observed for rs4135336, an intronic variant in <italic>PPARG</italic> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma). Rs4135336 shows an increase in allele A frequency by 47-fold (from 0.0007 in TEENAGE to 0.033 in MANOLIS). This variant appears to be monomorphic in all European (EUR) populations from the 1000 Genomes Project except in TSI where it has been observed at a frequency of 0.01. It is, however, common in African (AFR) populations and has reached 0.14 frequency in the Yoruban (YRI) population.</p><p>A total of 261 (0.04%) variants displayed an increase of &#x0003e;10-fold in Pomak versus TEENAGE and two variants displayed an increase of &#x0003e;50-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The highest fold difference was observed for rs12173144, an intergenic variant located between <italic>CDH9</italic> (cadherin 9, type 2 (T1-cadherin)) and <italic>CDH6</italic> (cadherin 6, type 2, K-cadherin (fetal kidney)) that shows an increase in allele G frequency by 59-fold (from 0.0007 in TEENAGE to 0.0423 in Pomak).

This suggests that positive selection could have acted on it. Since the longest segments shared between the Pomak haplotype and other populations were 183 and 230&#x02009;kb with the LWK, and 7&#x02009;kb with the TEENAGE, and the frequency and diversity of the haplotypes carrying the minor alleles were both highest in the LWK, this suggested a scenario where independent haplotypes had entered the two Greek populations from the LWK. We therefore modelled the entry of a variant into the Pomak population and first assessed how likely it was to reach the currently observed frequency by drift from an initial frequency of 0.01 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). This corresponds to 30 identical copies of a single allele entering the Pomak population, although it is perhaps more likely that only one copy entered. The time allowed for it to increase in frequency by drift was the maximum possible in this demographic model. Thus, the simulation is highly conservative for our purpose. Nevertheless, we find that the probability for one locus to drift from a frequency of 0.01&#x02013;0.046 or over is 0.19%, and thus unlikely to occur by chance. We then performed simulations with positive selection on this allele, using selection coefficients <italic>s</italic>=0.005, 0.007 and 0.01 acting on carriers. Here the probabilities of reaching the observed 0.046 frequency were higher: 0.83%, 1.45% and 2.85%, respectively. We therefore conclude that positive selection is likely to have acted on the Pomak haplotype. If a 1% chance of reaching the observed frequency of 0.046 is used as a criterion, then a selective coefficient between 0.005 and 0.007 is suggested given the demographic model used here.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Enrichment of missense variants</title><p>In the MANOLIS cohort we found a significant enrichment of missense variants among those variants that have increased in frequency above a fold change of 5, and all higher thresholds examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).

Ten times as many samples would be required to achieve 80% power to detect the observed effect in a nonisolated European population such as TEENAGE (risk allele frequency 0.0014).</p><p>It has been well documented that the use of genetically isolated populations can empower the identification of rare variants associated with complex traits, mainly through reduced allelic variability and genetic drift<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. Here we have established the HELIC cohorts as population isolates through various metrics in terms of levels of isolatedness, reduced haplotype complexity and genetic drift. Leveraging these unique characteristics we show power gains that can be afforded by the study of isolated populations both theoretically and empirically by detecting variant associations with clinically important complex traits.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study samples</title><p><italic>HELIC</italic>.

We found insufficient numbers of variants falling into each of the latter three categories; therefore, we limited further analysis to missense and synonymous variants only. To test for enrichment of missense and synonymous variants we used incrementally increasing thresholds of the fold change in allele frequency (1 &#x000d7; , 5 &#x000d7; , 10 &#x000d7; , 15 &#x000d7; , 20 &#x000d7; and 25 &#x000d7; ), and at each threshold we computed a contingency table comparing the number of missense and other variants found at a fold change higher than the threshold. We focused this analysis on fold changes in order to primarily capture relevant changes in allele frequency for low frequency and rare variants. We used odds ratios to quantify enrichment and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests to compute the significance of the result.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inbreeding depression</title><p>Linear regression was used to examine association of Fhom and F_ROH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> with height and with cardiometabolic traits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 11 and 12</xref>) from the HELIC and TEENAGE studies.

The bottom panel shows the per chromosome median (dark blue) and N50 (gold), in cM, of all shared haplotype chunks obtained from all the unrelated individuals (pi hat&#x0003c;0.2, see Methods) in each cohort. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs), obtained by bootstrapping using 1000 repeats of resampling without replacement, are denoted by the horizontal bars (where these are very tight they are not visible in the plot). The median chunk length tells us about the distribution of contigs; however, we may also be interested in what a randomly sampled location will look like. The N50 measures this; specifically, it is a chunk length such that 50% of all randomly chosen positions will fall in a chunk of at least that size.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms6345-f3"/></fig><fig id="f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Relative density curves showing the estimated number of generations to the common ancestor between an individual and their NN.</title><p>The results are from 100 randomly sampled SNPs from across the genome for the MANOLIS individuals (M), the Pomaks (P), the TEENAGE samples (T), each considered separately and a scenario where the MANOLIS individuals (M versus T) and the Pomaks (P versus T) each are forced to select NNs from the TEENAGE cohort.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms6345-f4"/></fig><fig id="f5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Association of variants at chr11p15.4 with MCV.</title><p>The <italic>x</italic> axis shows the genomic interval, the left <italic>y</italic> axis shows the statistical significance of association as negative log10 of <italic>P</italic> values (score test in GEMMA). rs7116019 was used as the reference SNP and its <italic>P</italic> value in the discovery set and post replication is denoted by the purple circle and diamond, respectively.
