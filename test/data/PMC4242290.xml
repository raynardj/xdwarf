nuclear receptor (NR) ligands that will trigger defined, therapeutically useful
sets of NR activities is of considerable importance. Repositioning of existing
approved drugs with known side effect profiles can provide advantages because de
novo drug design suffers from high developmental failure rates and undesirable
side effects which have dramatically increased costs. Ligands that target
estrogen receptor &#x003b2; (ER&#x003b2;) could be useful in a variety of diseases
ranging from cancer to neurological to cardiovascular disorders. In this
context, it is important to minimize cross-reactivity with ER&#x003b1;, which has
been shown to trigger increased rates of several types of cancer. Because of
high sequence similarities between the ligand binding domains of ER&#x003b1; and
ER&#x003b2;, preferentially targeting one subtype can prove challenging. Here, we
describe a sequential ligand screening approach comprised of complementary
in-house assays to identify small molecules that are selective for ER&#x003b2;.
Methods include differential scanning fluorimetry, fluorescence polarization and
a GAL4 transactivation assay. We used this strategy to screen several
commercially-available chemical libraries, identifying thirty ER&#x003b2; binders
that were examined for their selectivity for ER&#x003b2; versus ER&#x003b1;, and
tested the effects of selected ligands in a prostate cancer cell proliferation
assay. We suggest that this approach could be used to rapidly identify
candidates for drug repurposing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Screening</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>drugs</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptors</kwd><kwd>chemical libraries</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><def-list list-type="simple" list-content="abbreviations"><def-item><term>ER</term><def><p>estrogen receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x000a0;DSF</term><def><p>differential scanning fluorimetry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x000a0;DHEA</term><def><p>dehydroepiandrosterone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>E2</term><def><p>estradiol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x000a0;FP</term><def><p>fluorescence polarization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Gen</term><def><p>genistein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBD</term><def><p>ligand binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x000a0;NR</term><def><p>nuclear receptor</p></def></def-item></def-list></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate a variety of biological processes and are critically
important in the emergence, prevention, and treatment of an array of diseases. NRs
are regulated by small, exchangeable, lipophilic molecules, which make them optimal
targets for drug discovery [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While NRs are considered useful therapeutic
targets for prevention and/or treatment of diseases such as cancer [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], metabolic [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], efforts to develop new NR-based therapeutics have often been stalled
or curtailed due to unexpected side effects that can arise from undesired
cross-reactivity with other NRs and off-target effects. It is important to develop
approaches to selectively target therapeutically useful subsets of NR activities in
order to obtain effective NR drugs with improved side effect profiles.</p><p>One rapid route towards development of new safe treatments to target NRs could
involve repurposing of existing drugs. Drug repurposing includes several advantages
such as safety, financial, market potential, return on investment, out-licensing
potential, and time to market [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During
clinical trials, safety accounts for approximately 30% of drug failure rates [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since repurposed drugs already meet
established regulatory safety requirements, they possess a significant advantage
over competing drugs in development, leaving drug effectiveness for the particular
indication as the primary concern. While it may cost more than USD 800 million to
develop a drug de novo, repurposing averages approximately USD 8.4 million [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
The financial savings therefore create a significant economic incentive for this
avenue of drug development. What may be most significant to the end user, however,
is time to market. It is estimated to take 10 to 17 years to develop a drug de novo,
whereas a repositioned drug could be moved directly to phase II clinical trials
[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For these purposes, it is essential
to develop reliable methods to identify useful candidates among large numbers of
approved candidate drugs.</p><p>Estrogen receptor &#x003b2; (ER&#x003b2;) is an attractive target for drug development.
While original models of estrogen action suggested that only a single ER gene (which
encodes a protein that is now termed ER&#x003b1;) was responsible for transducing
signals of estradiol and other ligands [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>],
the discovery in 1996 of a second ER gene, encoding ER&#x003b2;, prompted a
reevaluation of the estrogen signaling system. It is now known that ER&#x003b1; and
ER&#x003b2; play different roles in gene regulation [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and that ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; have overlapping but distinctive
tissue distributions and non-redundant roles [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These considerations have led to the suggestion that ER&#x003b2;
could be an attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective agonists
to treat and prevent neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and other diseases, including autoimmune diseases, endometriosis,
depression, hypertension, and colon, breast, prostate, lung, and skin cancer [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is important that such ligands should
not cross-react with ER&#x003b1;, which triggers classical estrogenic side effects,
such as breast or uterine stimulation, thereby increasing a woman&#x02019;s chance of
developing breast or uterine cancer, and gynecomastia and decreased libido in men
[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Presently, natural and synthetic
estrogens for ER&#x003b2; are being studied in colon cancer, breast cancer, lung
cancer, schizophrenia, and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While the agonist ERB-041 failed to demonstrate efficacy in a Phase
II double-blind clincial trial for rheumatoid arthritis, further studies are
warranted to examine ER&#x003b2;-selective efficacy in other inflammatory disorders
[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With many other clinical trials
still in progress awaiting completion of the study followed by publication of the
findings, it is still too early to make any definitive conclusions about these drugs
and their effects. The discovery of potentially beneficial effects of selective
ER&#x003b2; ligands on prostate cancer proliferation and apoptosis in the absence of
full ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; agonism has raised hopes that applications for new
safe selective ER&#x003b2; modulator ligands could emerge in the context of this
disease [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Although ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; are highly homologous in their ligand-binding
domains (LBDs), differences exist in ligand binding affinity and/or specificity
between the ER subtypes. Further, the structural diversity of estrogenic chemicals
is very broad [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Environmental chemicals
(such as polychlorinated hydroxybiphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and
derivatives, alkylphenols, bisphenol A, methoxychlor and chlordecone) and
phytoestrogens (such as genistein, coumestrol and zearalenone) show estrogenic
activity and bind both ER subtypes, with some ligands showing stronger binding to
ER&#x003b2; [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, synthetic
estrogen agonists and antagonists have been developed with diverse chemical
structures, such as diethylstilbestrol, moxestrol, and tamoxifen. Fink <italic>et
al.</italic> [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] used a combinatorial
synthetic approach to modify an azole core structure to generate binding, while
others, such as Manas <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], employed molecular modeling for selectivity enhancement. To date,
however, highly selective antagonists have not been designed [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesize that it may be possible to identify novel and potentially useful ER
ligands among libraries of existing approved drugs. As mentioned, the ERs recognize
a broad range of non-steroidal ligand structures, exemplified by their recognition
of the hydroxystilbene backbone of diethylstilbestrol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and by the fact that many compounds act as
estrogenic endocrine disruptors. Non-steroidal ligands have gained attention as
potential ER therapeutics since they are thought to have diminished cross-reactivity
with other NRs, which can eliminate side effects, as well as altered physicochemical
properties, which can result in unique and potentially useful tissue
distributions.</p><p>To identify novel ER modulators, it is important to devise rapid and reliable methods
to detect ER ligands and to define subtype selectivity. Here, we report a screening
strategy for ER&#x003b2; ligands that relies on application of sequential orthogonal
assays. We present evidence that our overall screening strategy is effective at
identifying selective ER&#x003b2; modulators from a large collection of compound
libraries and test effects of representative ligands in an ER&#x003b2;-dependent
prostate cancer model system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Reagents were obtained from the following manufacturers: LB Broth, Ampicillin

containing a sequence encoding His<sub>6</sub>-hER&#x003b2; LBD (261-530).
Freshly transformed cells were grown at 22&#x000b0;C at 160 rpm in 1 L LB Broth
Miller supplemented with 1 mL of 100 mg/mL ampicillin per flask with a MultiTron
Incubated Shaker for approximately 24 hours until reaching mid-log phase of
growth. The culture was cooled to 16&#x000b0;C, induced with 1 mL of 100 mM IPTG
per 1 L culture, and allowed to continue to grow while shaking at 160 rpm for
another 24 hours. Cells were pelleted at 4000 x g at 4&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes
and resuspended in 40 mL of lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% BME (300 mM
NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 20 mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol @ pH 8.0) per 1 L culture. Cells
and/or protein were kept on ice or at 4&#x000b0;C throughout the purification.
Cells were pelleted again for 10 minutes at 3400 x g, the supernatant was
removed, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. One tablet of EDTA-free protease
inhibitor cocktail was added per 1 L culture, and the cells were resuspended in
lysis buffer and lysed by sonication using an Ultrasonic Liquid Processor. The
lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 34500 x g for 40 minutes. The
supernatant was added to HisPur Cobalt Resin (4 mL beads per culture) and placed
on a shaker in the cold room for between 1 and 1.5 hours and pelleted at 215 x g
for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the beads were resuspended in
lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% BME. The beads and buffer were poured
through a gravity-flow column in the cold room. After allowing the lysate to
flow-through, the column was washed with 20 mL of elution buffer supplemented
with 0.1% BME (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 300 mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol @ pH
8.0). The eluted protein was then concentrated by centrifuging with 10 kDa
centrifugal filter units at 2600 x g until the volume was less than 5 mL and
injected into an &#x000c4;KTApurifier FPLC and purified by gel filtration using a
HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 in gel filtration buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 10
mM DTT, 10% glycerol, @ pH 8.0). Fractions under the peak spanning at a
retention volume of around 60 mL were pooled and concentrated by centrifuging

performing differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) on varying concentrations of
protein and SYPRO orange in screening buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris, 0.001 M
DTT @ pH 7.4). For ER&#x003b2;, the optimal conditions were 0.02 mg/mL protein
(as determined by the absorbance at 280nm from a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer),
screening buffer and 2X SYPRO orange (diluted from 5000X concentrate) within the

determine ligand-dependent transactivation of ER&#x003b2; to distinguish agonism
from partial agonism or antagonism. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were
transiently transfected with GAL4 DBD-ER&#x003b2; LBD and a GAL4 response element
linked to a luciferase reporter gene (luc2P/9XGAL4UAS/Hygro) reporter. Cells
were plated and transfected at a density of 1.2x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well of
a 24-well plate using FuGENE&#x000ae; HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) and were
maintained in DMEM without phenol-red supplemented with charcoal stripped serum
and 1x Pen/Strep antibiotics (500 &#x003bc;L/well). Either vehicle (DMSO) or
increasing doses of the test compounds were added to the cells 24 hours after
transfection, and cells were assayed for luciferase activity after overnight
treatment. Luciferase values were normalized to a <italic>Renilla</italic>

measured on a Tecan Safire2&#x02122; Microplate Reader. The data was fit using
Prism software. Similar assays that employed expression vectors for full length
ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; were used to define effects of selected ligands on both
receptor subtypes. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with full length
ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; cloned into the pSG5 expression vector (Promega) and a
ERE response element linked to a luciferase reporter gene in pGL4 vector as
previously described [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Cells were
plated at a density of 1.0x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well of a 12-well plate and
maintained in DMEM without phenol-red supplemented with charcoal stripped serum

performed using the TransFectin Lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) with approximately 10
ng/well of full length ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2;, 10 ng/well of renilla
luciferase gene (Promega) for internal control and 200 ng/well of ERE-Luc.
Approximately, 5 h after transfections, cells were treated with compounds of
interest (1 &#x003bc;M final concentration), or solvent (DMSO). After overnight
incubation, luciferase activities were assessed using Dual Luciferase assay
reagent (Promega). Luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing firefly
luciferase to renilla luciferase signal. Normalized luciferase activities were
then represented relative to control (DMSO-treated cells).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation</title><p>Cell proliferation of LNCaP cells (ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CRL-1740&#x02122;) was

(1X), no phenol red (Gibco&#x000ae;) and phenol-free RPMI (Mediatech)
supplemented with charcoal stripped serum and 1x Pen/Strep antibiotics. Cells
were centrifuged, redispersed in complete media, and seeded in Corning black
96-well flat clear bottom microplates. Wells were filled with either 100
&#x003bc;L of complete media without cells (to obtain a value for background
luminescence) or media with cells. After 24 h, cells were treated with either 1
&#x003bc;L of DMSO or test compound (1 &#x003bc;M final concentration). After an
additional 24 h, the plate and its contents were equilibrated to room
temperature for approximately 30 minutes and an equal volume (100 &#x003bc;L) of
CellTiter-Glo&#x000ae; Reagent was added. Plates were shaken for 2 minutes on an
orbital shaker to induce cell lysis and allowed to incubate at room temperature
for 10 minutes to stabilize luminescent signal. Luminescence was recorded using

approach towards ER&#x003b2; ligand identification. This technique relies upon the
fact that protein stability is commonly enhanced upon ligand binding. Fundamentally,
as the increasing temperature forces protein unfold, normally buried residues of a
protein's hydrophobic core are exposed increasing the fluorescence of a dye
with an affinity for hydrophobic surface. The assay has been adapted for a
conventional real-time PCR instrument in our laboratory and can be performed with 96

several sources: The Prestwick Chemical Library<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (100% FDA
approved drugs), the NIH Clinical Collection (small molecules with a history of use
in human clinical trials), the Custom Clinical Collection (57% of compounds are
currently used in the clinic for the treatment of various forms of cancer and 37% of
compounds are in clinical trials), NCI Diversity (compounds identified using the
program Chem-X, which uses defined centers and defined distance intervals to create
a particular finite set of pharmacophores) [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], Natural Products (selected from an open repository of 140,000
compounds), Mechanistic (compounds tested in the NCI human tumor 60 cell line
screen), and Challenge Sets (compounds of novel structural types). We were able to
eliminate a large number of false positives by manual curation. Several compounds
which scored as hits were eliminated because of large volume and complex chemical
structure which suggested that they should not bind inside the ER&#x003b2; pocket
(which is approximately 450 cubic angstroms and twice the molecular volume occupied
by the estradiol molecule itself) [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]
in a conventional manner. After this step, we were left with 60 potential hit
compounds that elicited a noticeable and significant change in the melting
temperature of the purified ER&#x003b2; LBD protein.</p><p>Detection of 60 putative binders from the initial screen corresponded to a 2% primary
hit rate, which appeared slightly high. It is not unusual for promiscuous compounds
to invade compound screening and appear active in many assays; therefore,
substructure filters have been developed to help reduce pan assay interference
[<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We systematically and manually
filtered and removed interference compounds and reduced the list to 40 potential
putative ER&#x003b2; binding compounds (yielding a 1.3% hit rate, which appeared
genuine). Our remaining ligand set produced denaturation curves with discernable
transitions when compared to unliganded ER&#x003b2; LBD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows the negative derivative of the melting traces
(derivative curves) obtained with several small molecules screened that were
identified as potential ER&#x003b2; ligands. These compounds yielded ideal traces
with a symmetric, sharp, and upward-shifted peak. For all these ER&#x003b2; putative
binders, the derivative curves invert in intensity and shifted upward representing
conditions in which the protein is the most stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b-d</xref>). The compounds fall in various chemical and structural
classes such as nonsteroidal (ex: pterostilbene) and steroidal (ex: ethylestrenol),
triphenylethylene antiestrogens (ex: clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen), diphenyl
derivatives (ex: hexestrol), natural estrogens (ex: estrone, equilin,
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)), phytoestrogens (ex: zeranol, coumestrol,
naringenin), as well as synthetic (ex: stanozolol) and semisynthetic (ex: ethinyl
estradiol). It is not surprising that such structurally distinct ligands with full
agonistic, SERMs, or antagonistic properties all show affinity for this receptor and
are identified in the screening cascade.</p><p>We also determined whether DSF could verify whether a ligand introduced during
protein expression and purification was incorporated into the LBD. This is important
because purification of a protein does not guarantee that it remains folded in its
native state and addition of ligand during bacterial expression can increase yields
of soluble correctly folded protein. When the small molecule DHEA was added to the
bacterial culture at 1 &#x003bc;M in DMSO prior to induction with IPTG and maintained
at 1 &#x003bc;M in the gel filtration buffer throughout purification, the
His<sub>6</sub>-hER&#x003b2; LBD purification product produced an inverted
derivative curve with a Tm of ~55 &#x000ba;C, increased over Tm values obtained with
purified unliganded ER&#x003b2; LBD (see Supplementary File 2). These data provide
independent verification that DHEA scored as an ER&#x003b2; binder in DSF assays and
confirmed that the addition of ligand during purification steps allows for the
ligand to be incorporated into the LBD and maintain proper tertiary structure.</p><p>While DSF offers a simple platform for rapid identification of interacting ligands,
the assay is essentially qualitative and does not assess binding affinity. To
confirm initial hits and more accurately rank the ligands based on affinity, we
applied a secondary screening assay based on a commercially available fluorescence
polarization (FP) assay to define ligand displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Here, test compounds were analyzed for their ability to
displace a fluorescently labeled ligand (in this case fluorescein labeled E2) from
ERs. The reduced size of the free molecule can be discerned by increased mobility in
solution, which is detected by FP. The observed FP value depends on free and bound
fractions of labeled molecules. We utilized paired kits to measure the ability of
test compounds to displace ligands from both ER&#x003b2; and ER&#x003b1; to obtain
initial estimates of selectivity.</p><fig id="f3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>FP assay to verify ligand hits from compound libraries and determine

compounds with the greatest affinity for the protein. Error bars represent
one standard deviation from the mean of triplicate reaction wells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nrs-12-003-g3"/></fig><p>The initial 40 hit compounds identified from the primary assay were reduced to 30 hit
compounds (see Supplementary File 3) after the secondary FP assay, indicating that
these 30 compounds can effectively compete with E2 for binding to either ER&#x003b2;
or ER&#x003b1; at physiological concentrations. The data are fit with a non linear
regression curve fit using SigmaPlot&#x000ae; software. The relative affinities of
the 30 test compounds for ER&#x003b2; and ER&#x003b1; are indicated by the
IC<sub>50</sub> values listed in Supplementary File 3, in which compounds are
listed by their affinity for ER&#x003b2;. Selectivity was determined by dividing the
IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained with ER&#x003b2; by ER&#x003b1;. It should be
noted that the ranking of the ligands based on change in ER&#x003b2; melting
temperature correlated very well with the affinity determined from the FP assay.
These data also fit with previous analyses in which coumestrol, zeranol, narigenin,
and kaempferol were all found to compete more effectively with E2 for binding to
ER&#x003b2; than to ER&#x003b1;, and in which coumestrol and zeranol had higher
ranking in affinity than narigenin and kaempferol for both ER subtypes [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It was surprising that an unambiguous fit
for kaempferol with ER&#x003b1; could not be obtained since it displays ER&#x003b1;
binding affinity in a radioligand-competition assay, however the authors of that
study did note that complete displacement of the radioligand from the ER&#x003b1;
protein could not be obtained for this ligand [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another surprising finding was the order of competition for estriol
and estrone, such that estriol displayed greater relative affinity than estrone for
both ER&#x003b2; and ER&#x003b1;. These two physiological estrogens were ranked in the
reverse order by Kuiper <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Otherwise, the Kuiper <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] radioligand binding competition assay
results show high similarities to our data confirming that estradiol, hexestrol,
diethylstilbestrol, coumestrol, zeranol, estrone, estriol, clomiphene, tamoxifen and
DHEA were binders for both ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;.</p><p>In order to designate ligands as agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, we next
evaluated the ability of these compounds to modulate the transcriptional activity of
ER&#x003b2;. The transcriptional response of the ligands was measured using a
well-defined system comprised of transfected receptor LBD linked to a GAL4 DNA
binding function and a GAL4 responsive reporter in an ER-negative mammalian cell
line. Results are expressed as normalized luciferase activity (normalized to Renilla
for transfection efficiency). As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure
4</xref>, many compounds induced transactivation of ER&#x003b2; in a
dose-dependent manner. Compared with E2, the other dose-response curves are shifted
to the right, reflecting the differences in affinity of these compounds for
ER&#x003b2;. The system also demonstrated different ligand classifications, namely,
agonists, partial agonists, and/or antagonists. For example, when examined in a dose
response manner in antagonist mode with 5 nM E2, clomiphene citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref>, yellow x) displays an IC<sub>50</sub>
of 221 nM. With increasing concentration of clomiphene citrate, a dose-dependent
decrease in luciferase activity is found in the presence of E2, demonstrating the
compound&#x02019;s ability to block the estrogen response. Calculated EC50/IC50
values are listed in Supplementary File 3.</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Cell-based transactivation assay to evaluate the ability of ligands to

are listed in Supplementary File 4, where &#x003b2;-selectivity (fold) was greater
than 2 and calculated by dividing the compound&#x02019;s half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for ER&#x003b1; by that for ER&#x003b2; as determined
from FP. In this screening cascade we had set out to look for &#x003b2;-selectivity
and discovered nine leads compounds based solely on the data from fluorescence
polarization assays with the DSF assay lending additional confirmation of ligand
binding. These nine lead ligands (Supplementary File 4) include hexestrol,
coumestrol, methylandrostenediol, luteolin, naringenin, mifepristone, DHEA,
medicarpin, and kaempferol.</p><p>We next examined effects of selected ligands that were identified in the cascade and
displayed different activities and ER subtype selectivity in transfections with full
length ERs versus cells treated with E2 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). E2 (full agonist) activated both receptors, with ER&#x003b1;
activity higher than that of ER&#x003b2;. By contrast, one of the ligands described
in Supplementary File 4, DHEA, displayed strong ER&#x003b2; selectivity, with greater
capacity for ER&#x003b2; activation than the selective partial agonist
27-hydroxycholesterol [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Finally, clomifene failed to activate
either ER subtype, consistent with antagonist activity.</p><fig id="f5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Cell-based transactivation assay to evaluate the ability of ligands to

prostate cancer cell proliferation. In accordance with previous results [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>],
the full agonist E2 did not affect LNCaP cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Suppression of proliferation was obtained with DHEA,
27-hydroxycholesterol, and clomifene. Accordingly, our findings support the concept
that certain ER&#x003b2; ligands induce anti-proliferative activities in prostate
cancer cells that are not shared with the full agonist E2. We propose that our
screening cascade has the capacity to identify compounds with these potentially
desirable activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although DSF is a commonly used technique for primary screens, it is also known to
generate false positives, and we observed this problem in the current study. For
example, dactinomycin (NIH Clinical Collection), goserelin acetate (NIH Clinical
Collection), antimycin A (Prestwick Library), lithocholic acid (Prestwick Library)
and nystatin (Prestwick Library) were omitted but also elicited changes in the
protein melting temperature. These antibiotics, antifungals, and amphiphiles act as
nonspecific effectors by either adsorbing to plastics, creating micelles and
interacting with the dye to form aggregates that may destabilize the protein; or by
weakly electrostatically interacting with the protein, as opposed to binding inside
the ligand-binding pocket. Nystatin, for example, has been shown to perturb ligand
binding to receptors [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and dactinomycin,
also known as actinomycin D, has been reported to inhibit the nuclear processing of
estrogen receptors in MCF-7 cells [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
Additionally, some compounds, such as felodipine (Prestwick Library) and
dactinomycin (NIH Clinical Collection) were colored, another common cause of
interference with the optical detection of fluorescence in DSF. While these
compounds also showed up as hits in the primary assay, they were omitted from
Supplementary File 3 based on their complicated chemical structures. For ER&#x003b1;
LBD when the data was fit using Graphpad Prism with a nonlinear regression curve fit
for the compounds mifepristone and kaempferol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure
3</xref>) the IC50 values yielded were ambiguous and therefore excluded. The
remaining compounds, however, displayed good correlation between the different
assays, where the melting temperature of the protein with the addition of test
compound from DSF can be compared with the IC50 determined from the fluorescence
polarization assay. Generally, as the melting temperature identified using DSF
decreased, the IC50 of the corresponding ligand, identified using FP, increased
(Supplementary File 3).</p><p>The use of highly purified material in initial screens is critical. Our initial
trials with partially purifed protein identified more than one melting transition,
and we speculate that one of the two melting transitions observed by DeSantis
<italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] for their
human ER&#x003b1; LBD (likely the ligand independent transition at 41 &#x000ba;C) is
due to the presence of a contaminant such as a chaperone or ribosomal protein that
yielded its own melting transition. The use of additional purification steps such as
a gel filtration column, can help yield a more pure product and eliminate additional
unrelated melting transitions that might otherwise confound the experimental system
and results.</p><p>The trial screen used here identified nine ER&#x003b2; selective ligands from around
3000 compounds. In agreement with previous radioligand binding assay findings from
Kuiper <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the
K<sub>i</sub> for the competitior compounds DHEA and coumestrol were both lower
for ER&#x003b2; than ER&#x003b1;, indicating ER&#x003b2; selectivity, while the
K<sub>i</sub> for hexestrol was the same for both isoforms. In fact, coumestrol
is widely considered an ER&#x003b2;-selective agonist ligand [<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The literature
is not as definitive for the other phytoestrogens identified here, likely because
the ability of a compound to selectively bind to a particular ER subtype can be
species dependent [<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In a radioligand
binding assay-based investigation of the ligand binding profiles of both ER subtypes
from human, rat, and mouse, Harris <italic>et al.</italic> reported a lower
IC<sub>50</sub> for the interaction of kaempferol with human ER&#x003b2; than
with ER&#x003b1;, while for narigenin, an IC<sub>50</sub> value was obtained for
human ER&#x003b2; only [<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally,
both narigenin and kaempferol were found to act as weaker agonists (as compared to
coumestrol and others) in a study evaluating transcriptional activation of MCF-7
cells transiently transfected with either ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; and an
ERE-reporter plasmid. Moreover, a sigmoidal dose-response curve model was fit and an
EC<sub>50</sub> determined for ER&#x003b2; transfected cells, the EC<sub>50</sub>
for both narigenin and kaempferol for ER&#x003b1; was not determined due to a lack of
full dose response to these ligands [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
Luteolin has also been studied for its ability to activate ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2;
in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells, and was found to have a very slight effect
on ER&#x003b2; but no effect on ER&#x003b1; [<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. While direct binding measurements of medicarpin to ERs have not been
reported, selective knockdown of both ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; in osteoblasts
demonstrated that the osteogenic action of medicarpin is ER&#x003b2;-dependent [<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although the selectivity of
methyandrostenediol (methandriol) for ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; has also not been
reported, its parent compound 5-androstenediol activates ERs [<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and is ER&#x003b2; selective [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], suggesting that similar properties for methyandrostenediol
would not be unexpected. Moreover, Mifepristone (RU-486) has been found to be
ER&#x003b2; selective in a screen of the ToxCast library, although no affinity values
were reported [<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our screen has identified
a mix of known ER&#x003b2; selective ligands, as well as novel ligands with possible
ER&#x003b2; selective activities.</p><p>It should be mentioned that some compounds and plant extracts, such as MF101, have
been shown to have equal binding to both ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; subtypes, but
display ER&#x003b2; specific proliferative gene activation [<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Additionally
the compound 3,3&#x02019;-diindolylmethane did not bind selectively to ER&#x003b2; but
selectively activated multiple endogenous genes by recruiting ER&#x003b2; and
coactivators to target genes [<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore,
it is clear that binding preference, activation, and gene targeting create a complex
issue in determining ligand effectiveness.</p><p>Our screen relies primarily upon detection of ER&#x003b2; selective binding and
examining large numbers of compounds in gene activation and cell proliferation
assays requires further studies. We did, however, assess capacity of our screen to
identify ligands with selective ER&#x003b2; modulator activities during prostate
cancer proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Previous
studies showed that certain ER&#x003b2; ligands inhibit prostate cancer cell
proliferation and increase apoptosis and that this capacity is distinct from full
agonist activity [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Accordingly, whereas the full agonist estradiol does not
alter LNCaP proliferation, DHEA (identified from our screening cascade),
27-hydroxycholesterol (a known SERM with ER&#x003b2; activity [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), and the antagonist clomifene do. Of these, DHEA displays
striking selectivity for ER&#x003b2; versus ER&#x003b1;. Accordingly, we were able to
identify ligands with potentially useful effects on prostate cancer proliferation,
and further screening of this ligand subset could identify other compounds with
useful selective modulator activities.</p><p>While the LBD specificity of some ligands for ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; has been
assessed, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for ER&#x003b1; have
been ranked in different species, such as human, dog, and cat [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the identification of differential binding of compounds
substantiates the prospect of developing ER-selective drugs. Our approach also helps
make evident the structural features that are important for ER binding and
contributes to the accumulated knowledge of ligand structure activity relationship
(SAR) for this molecule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Herein we have demonstrated the use of a screening cascade consisting of a primary
thermofluor assay to qualitatively monitor changes in protein melting upon ligand
binding and allow for the rapid elimination of non-binders from our small molecule
collection. We included a secondary FP assay to quantitatively determine receptor
subtype preference and affinity (&#x003b2; versus &#x003b1;<bold>)</bold>. This assay
was performed to eliminate any potential false positives initially obtained and
determine relative binding affinity. The tertiary cell-based GAL4 transactivation
assay offers the ability to qualitatively determine ligand dependent transactivation
of ER&#x003b2;. Transactivation activity information is highly valuable to generate
SAR and further identifies which compounds elicit an ER&#x003b2; mediated response.
The overall screening strategy provides a method to rank affinity for
lead-optimization and reduces the uncertainty of the potential of a compound to bind
to the protein of interest. Compounds with overlapping activity in binding,
functional, and cell-based assays provide the best screening hits and lead compounds
to be further explored for drug repurposing as they indicate activity regardless of
the assay employed. We showed that several selected ligands, including a known SERM
(27-hydroxycholesterol), a ER&#x003b2; selective ligand identified from the cascade
(DHEA), and an antagonist identified from the cascade (clomiphene), demonstrated
effects on cell proliferation using a prostate cancer cell line as our disease
model. As we have shown, several ER&#x003b2;-selective SERMs were identified from a
large collection of compound libraries, including known endogenous ligands as well
as synthetic compounds that are now off patent. By beginning with libraries
containing a pool of safe, off patent compounds, chemicals that are selective for
ER&#x003b2; can be further evaluated for drug repurposing.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold>&#x000a0;The authors declare no competing
