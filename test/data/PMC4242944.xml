stabilization, few studies have examined its effects at different angles of shoulder
rotation. Therefore, the present study investigated the most effective exercise method for
shoulder stabilization by analyzing muscle activities of the rotator cuff muscles at
different angles of shoulder rotation. [Subjects] Fifteen healthy university students in
their 20s were the subjects of this study. [Methods] Changes in muscle EMG related to
shoulder stabilization were analyzed by performing the Push-Up Plus in shoulder positions
of neutral, internal and external rotation. [Results] The highest muscle activity was
found in external rotation, and in internal rotation the pectoralis major and levator
scapula showed significantly lower activities than the other positions. [Conclusion]
Selectively changing the rotation angle of the shoulder for different purposes of the
shoulder exercise would be an effective exercise method.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Shoulder</kwd><kwd>Stabilization</kwd><kwd>Rotation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The rotator cuff is the most important muscle group for shoulder stabilization. In shoulder
stabilization, the rotator cuff controls many active joint movements occurring in the
glenohumeral joint. The rotator cuff has three main functions: it rotates the humeral head;
it presses the humeral head down, stabilizing the head in the joint pit; and, it stabilizes
the shoulder muscles by maintaining proper balance when the other big muscles, that cross
shoulder joint contract<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The serratus
anterior (SA) is also considered to be an important shoulder muscle stabilization. Proper
activity of the SA is important for maintaining normal scapulohumeral rhythm during arm
raises. SA holds the scapula to the thorax when the humerus is raised in flexion and
abduction. It also prevents winging of the scapula and helps the scapula to tilt posterior
in upward rotation. SA shows abnormal muscle activity in various kinds of pathological
condition of the shoulder muscle<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
plays an important role in the scapula stabilization and strengthening of SA significantly
contributes to shoulder stabilization<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, the Push-Up Plus (PUP) exercise has been widely used as an exercise method to
strengthen the rotator cuff. PUP is an effective exercise method that decreases action of
the trapezius muscle and increases activity of SA. Among PUP exercises, it is known that
exercise on an unstable base of support has the most effect<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise methods for
shoulder stabilization, to improve rehabilitation of patients with shoulder damage, have
continuously improved with time. However, there have been few studies of the effects of PUP
exercise at different shoulder rotation angles. The muscles of the rotator cuff change their
length with rotation of the shoulder joint strength, and muscle tension changes with length.
Thus, strength will also change with shoulder rotation. Therefore, the present study
investigated most effective exercise method for shoulder stabilization by analyzing the
muscle activities of the rotator cuff at various shoulder rotation angles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 15 healthy D university students, in their 20s (5 males, 10
females), who had no restriction on exercise, and no shoulder pain within the previous 3
months. None of them had a history of shoulder surgery. Written informed consent was
received from each subject. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic
University of Pusan.</p><p>To measure muscle activity, a surface electromyography system (Noraxon, USA) was used.
Electrodes were attached to the upper trapezius (UT), lower trapezius (LT), levator scapula
(LS), supra spinatus (SS), infra spinatus (IS), posterior deltoid (PD), serratus anterior

shoulder rotation angles were measured during PUP on an unstable surface provided by a
sling. The subjects practiced for 5 minutes before the measurements to learn the scapula
protraction at the different rotation angles, and subjects were instructed not to raise
their thoracic vertebrae too much in reaction to the protraction. All exercises were
performed in the quadruped position, with the hip and shoulder joints at 90-degree angles
and the sling suspending the hands 5&#x02005;cm above the floor at the start of the PUP
exercises.</p><p>In the present study, the posion with both thumbs up and the back of the hands facing
outwards was called the neutral rotation (NR) position. The position with both thumbs facing
each other, at a 90&#x000b0; rotation from the NR position was called the internal rotation (IR)
position. The position with both thumbs facing outwards, a 60&#x000b0; rotation from the NR
position, was called the external rotation (ER) position. Since muscle activity can be
changed by the order of measurement, measurements were taken in the following order: NR, IR
and ER; IR, ER and NR; ER, NR, IR. The average values of the 3 measurements were used. Three
minutes of break time were provided between each measurement. To avoid any changes in
positions due to movement of the head, or the position of the trunk, a posture correction
stick was used.</p><p>To prevent subjects from flexing or extending of their neck during the measurements, they
were told to pull in their chin, and measurement, each angle was controlled to touch the
stick with the back of their heads to maintain the alignment of their back and hips. After

overall. Compared to the neutral position, PUP with ER showed significantly higher
activities of SS, IS, SA, and PM. Through its structural characteristics, the rotator cuff
provides comprehensive force to the glenohumeral joint and act as a static and dynamic
stabilizer<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SS, IS, and SA play
important roles in shoulder stabilization<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and PM provides a role as a dynamic
stabilizer during arm movement. SA is a direct muscle that holds the scapula to the trunk.
It provides a role as a lever, controls abduction and upward rotation of the scapula and
keep the scapula flat to costal angle<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When the SA is weakened, winging of the scapula occurs, and to compensate for this,
excessive work of UT occurs, resulting in abnormal the scapula movement<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many researchers are studying stabilization of the
scapula to find ways of stabilizing the upper extremity, and they are looking for ways to
selectively strengthen the rotator cuff and SA. In the present study, significant increases
in SS, IS, PM, and SA activities were found, compared to PUP exercise in the NR and IR
positions when PUP was performed with external rotation of the shoulder. PUP exercise with
external rotation showed the highest activity in almost all the muscles.</p><p>Unlike the normal movement of the shoulder, when a subject has pain or problems with the
movement pattern, the strategy for shoulder stabilization needs to be different from that
for people with no problem or no pain. Sahrmann<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> defined as &#x0201c;movement impairment syndrome&#x0201d;, and explained that it
can result in pain at certain sites due to abnormal movement of the scapula and upper arms.
It can also result in increase or decrease of scope of joint movement, stress in a certain
direction or compensation movement in a certain direction due to directional susceptibility
to movement, and decrease of muscle strength. Mottram<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that proper force couple should be recovered through
appropriate isometric exercise which provides the muscle stability necessary to recover from
these abnormal scapula movements. Ludewig PM et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that the push-up plus is an ideal exercise for people with
excessive UT muscle activity or people with UT and SA imbalance and this has been confirmed
in many studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study observed the muscle activities of different shoulder rotation angles
during PUP, and PUP with IR showed significantly lower PM and LS when activities than PUP
with NR or ER. Excessive activity of PM and LS can result in imbalance in the neck and
shoulders. Chaitow<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> defined this as
upper crossed syndrome (UCS) nothing that while patients with UCS have overly tensioned PM,
UT and LS, they have weakened deep cervical flexors, LT and SA. Despite the low PM and LS
activities observed in PUP with IR, higher LT and SA activities were found than in PUP with
NR. Thus, PUP with IR can be recommended as a selective exercise method for patients with
UCS, which results from excessive PM and LS, for in strengthening the rotator cuff and SA
while minimizing PM and LS activities.</p><p>The present study had some limitations. There were only 15 subjects of the study, and they
were healthy subjects in their 20s with no shoulder pain. So it is difficult to generalize
the results to those who have shoulder disease, UCS or for elderly people. In addition, in
this we used surface electromyography, therefore, it was not possible to analyze the muscle
activities of the teres minor or subscapularis. Therefore, in further studies, it will be
necessary to address these limitations.</p><p>The present study investigated out the most efficient shoulder stabilization exercise
method by observing the activities of muscles around shoulder during PUP with different
rotation angles of the shoulder. According to the results of the present study, PUP with ER
is the most effective stabilization exercise, since it showed significantly higher
activities of SS, IS, SA and PM than the other positions. In addition, PUP with IR was found
to be the exercise method that can selectively strengthen SS, IS and LT while minimizing the
activities of PM and LS. Therefore, selecting different rotation angles of the shoulder for
different purpose of shoulder exercise is to be an effective exercise method.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sharkey</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Marder</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The rotator cuff opposes superior translation of the
