We provide evidence for a role of receptors of the innate immune system in virally induced inflammation of the endothelium in vitro and in vivo. Corresponding to the in vitro finding of an HCV-dependent induction of proinflammatory mediators in endothelial cells, mice treated with poly (I:C) exhibit a significant reduction in leukocyte rolling velocity, an increase in leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall and an increased extravasation of leukocytes. HCV directly promotes activation, adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the vessel wall by activation of endothelial viral receptors. Poly (I:C) induces the expression of TLR3 in vivo and hereby allows for amplification of all of the aforementioned responses upon viral infection. Proinflammatory effects of viral RNA are specifically mediated by TLR3 and significantly enhanced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;). HCV-RNA induces the endothelial expression of TNF&#x003b1; and TNF&#x003b1; receptor subtype 2 and we provide evidence that leucocyte adhesion and transmigration in response to activation of viral RNA receptors seem to depend on expression of functional TNFR2. Our results demonstrate that endothelial cells actively participate in immune mediated vascular inflammation caused by viral infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grant WO 1716/1-1 from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), a grant from the Else Kr&#x000f6;ner-Fresenius-Stiftung and the Wilhelm-Vaillant-Stiftung to MW and a grant from The Friedrich Baur Stiftung to JP.

Besides liver disease, HCV infection is frequently associated with a variety of autoimmune phenomenona with extrahepatic manifestations including cryoglobulinemia <xref rid="pone.0113351-Agnello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Ferri1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, renal disease <xref rid="pone.0113351-Perico1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and vasculitis <xref rid="pone.0113351-Agnello1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Ferri1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Cacoub1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Cacoub2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Vassilopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Extrahepatic manifestations are often severe and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. We have previously shown the impact of activation of viral receptors of the innate immune system, particularly TLR3, on HCV-associated glomerulonephritis <xref rid="pone.0113351-Wrnle1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Wrnle2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Merkle1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Here we provide evidence for a role of receptors of the innate immune system in virally induced inflammation of the endothelium.</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an essential part of the innate immune system. TLR recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and are expressed on immune cells but also on a number of non-immune cells. TLR recognize molecular patterns associated with microbial pathogens and induce an immune response <xref rid="pone.0113351-Akira1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. TLR3 specifically binds dsRNA of viral origin as well as polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)), a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA <xref rid="pone.0113351-Alexopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Besides TLR3, the helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) may also act as sensors of viral infections by recognition of viral dsRNA <xref rid="pone.0113351-Matsukura1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Vitour1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Yount1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Here we show that both poly (I:C) and HCV-RNA isolated from patients infected with the Hepatitis C virus induce the endothelial expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons as well as adhesion molecules. These effects of viral RNA on endothelial cells are specifically mediated by TLR3. Furthermore, we demonstrate an immunomodulatory role of the TNF&#x003b1;/TNF receptor system in HCV-associated vasculitis with a potential impact on the development of new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were provided by Ades et al. <xref rid="pone.0113351-Ades1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% endothelial growth medium (PromoCell, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and cultured as described previously <xref rid="pone.0113351-Mannell1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The procedure was approved by the university ethics review board (Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Fakult&#x000e4;t der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&#x000e4;t). Written informed consent for the collection and generation of the cell lines was obtained. Cytokines were used in a concentration of 25 ng/ml (TNF&#x003b1;), 10 ng/ml (IL-1&#x003b2;) and 20 ng/ml (IFN-&#x003b3;). For cytokine prestimulation experiments, HMEC were incubated with a combination of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; for 12 hours, washed with PBS, left in culture medium for 6 hours and washed again with PBS. Subsequently, HMEC were incubated with growth medium (control) or medium containing poly (I:C). For poly (I:C) prestimulation experiments, HMEC were incubated with poly (I:C) (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) for 24 hours, then washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated with TNF&#x003b1; for different time intervals as indicated. For each stimulation experiment controls were performed in parallel using culture medium alone.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal experiments were performed in wild-type (WT) and TNF&#x003b1; receptor subtype 2-deficient (TNFR2<sup>-/-</sup>) C57BL/6 mice. WT mice were purchased from Charles River (Germany) and TNFR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (USA). Surgical procedures were performed under short-term anesthesia induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of midazolam 3 mg/kg (Ratiopharm, Germany), fentanyl 0.03 mg/kg (CuraMED Pharma, Germany), and medetomidinhydrochloride 0.3 mg/kg (Pfizer, Germany; produced by Orion Pharma, Finland) diluted in 0.9% NaCl. After the experiments, the animals were killed by injection of an overdose (2 g/kg) of sodium pentobarbital (Merial, Germany). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the German animal protection law and approved by the district government of Upper Bavaria (approval reference number AZ 55.2-1-54-2531-162-08) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The investigation conforms to Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament. Due to the narrow species restriction of HCV which allows infection of humans and chimpanzees only and the resulting lack of non-chimeric small animal models which would allow for direct studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV), stimulation experiments were performed with intraperitoneal injection of poly (I:C) as indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mouse blood cell counts</title><p>Mouse blood was collected via a carotid catheter and EDTA used as anticoagulant.

Mice were anesthetized and the right carotid artery was cannulated for administration of fluorescent microspheres to determine blood flow velocity. The cremaster muscle was prepared for intravital microscopy as originally described by Baez et al <xref rid="pone.0113351-Baez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Throughout the procedure the muscle was kept warm and moist by superfusion of warm buffered saline. In the applied in vivo model, leukocyte adhesion in cremaster muscle venules is induced by the surgical preparation and observed for up to 45 minutes after exteriorization of the cremaster muscle. Intravital microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiotech Vario microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and leukocyte-endothelium-interaction was analyzed in 5&#x02013;6 postcapillary venules and recorded using a digital camera (AxioCam HSm, Zeiss Germany). For measurement of blood flow velocity, green fluorescent microspheres (1 &#x000b5;m diameter; Polysciences, Germany) were injected via the carotid artery catheter, and their passage through the vessels of interest was recorded using the respective fluorescent filter cube. Blood flow was calculated from the length of a single microsphere in a single image with defined exposure time. Rolling leukocytes were defined as those moving slower than the blood flow and their velocity was calculated from the distance they were moving in a defined time frame. Firmly adherent cells were determined as those resting in vessel for more than 30 seconds of observation and related to the luminal surface of the observed vessel part. For investigation of extravasated leukocytes, whole mounts of the Cremaster muscles were performed immediately after sacrifying the animals and Giemsa-staining was used to label perivascular leukocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis</title><p>RT-PCR analysis was done as described <xref rid="pone.0113351-Wrnle1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

HMEC show a robust expression of TLR1, TLR4 and TLR6 without significant changes after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines. Under basal conditions, no relevant expression was found for TLR2 and TLR7, but these receptors were inducible by the cytokine combination. The expression for TLR9, both basal and after stimulation, was too low to allow for evaluation.

However, so far there are no data on the contribution of endothelial viral receptors of the innate immune system, which are able to bind nucleic acids of viral origin and elicit proinflammatory responses, to HCV-associated vasculitis. There is large body of evidence for several receptors for dsRNA existing in eukaryontic cells, including TLR3 and the cytosolic receptors RIG-I and MDA5 <xref rid="pone.0113351-Karik1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Kleinman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

We infer that HCV directly promotes activation, adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the vessel wall by activation of viral receptors of the innate immune system in endothelial cells. Due to the ability of HCV to both recruit leucocytes to the endothelium and sustain local inflammatory responses, any relevant viremia could cause a clinically apparent vasculitis. As a matter of fact, in mice systemically treated with the synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA poly (I:C), we found a significant reduction in leukocyte rolling velocity as well as an increase in leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall, which was paralleled by a significantly increased extravasation of leukocytes in vivo. In addition, poly (I:C) induces the expression of the corresponding receptor TLR3 in vivo and hereby allows for amplification of all of the aforementioned responses upon viral infection. These findings underscore the relevance of direct effects of circulating nucleic acids of viral origin on the pathogenesis of vasculitis. In vitro stimulation of viral receptors with poly (I:C) causes a time- and dose- dependent induction of IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, MCP-1, IP-10 and IFN-&#x003b2; as well as MCSF and the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HMEC. Using knockdown experiments with siRNAs specific for the viral receptors TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5, we provide evidence for a mutual dependence of the regulation of viral RNA receptors upon ligand binding as well as for a selective mediation of the poly (I:C)-dependent induction of proinflammatory genes by TLR3. We presume these effects to promote vascular inflammation in vivo once circulating HCV-RNA binds to viral receptors of the innate immune system, a process which does not presuppose viral entry and replication in endothelial cells. Even though not classifying as primary target cells of HCV, however, HMEC express CD81 tetraspanin, the scavenger receptor class B type I, tight junction proteins and LDL receptors, all of them able to mediate HCV entry into hepatic and non-hepatic cells <xref rid="pone.0113351-Cocquerel1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Burlone1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, human brain endothelial cells have already been found to express functional receptors that support HCV entry and replication <xref rid="pone.0113351-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The contribution of a direct viral infection of HMEC to extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection thus merits future attention.</p><p>An important mediator involved in both the early antiviral response and a variety of immune and autoimmune phenomena associated with viral diseases is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;). Referring to vasculitis in particular, TNF&#x003b1; is known to partly mediate the prothrombotic conditions implicated by systemic inflammation, and small vessel occlusion results in an amplification of local inflammatory responses. In this manuscript we show that TNF&#x003b1; adds significantly to the proinflammatory effects of viral RNA on endothelial cells and therefore plays an important role in the initiation and propagation of vascular manifestations of HCV-infection. In addition, we show for the first time that HCV-RNA containing cryoprecipitates significantly induce the endothelial expression of TNF&#x003b1; and TNF&#x003b1; receptor subtype 2 (TNFR2) in vitro and we provide evidence that leucocyte adhesion and transmigration in response to activation of viral RNA receptors in vivo seem to depend on the expression of functional TNFR2. While TNFR1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues, the expression of TNFR2 is highly regulated and mediates tissue damage in chronic inflammation; this effect possibly depends on the induction of endogenous TNF&#x003b1; via activation of TNFR2, which increases local TNF&#x003b1; concentrations and subsequently activates TNFR1 <xref rid="pone.0113351-Wajant1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Our observation of a selective induction of TNFR2 by HCV-RNA and the requirement of functional TNFR2 for endothelium-dependent leucocyte activation in poly (I:C)-treated mice would again favour the therapeutic use of a TNFR2-specific antagonist, already advocated for its potential to downregulate excessive TNF&#x003b1; signaling in uncontrolled inflammatory processes without affecting beneficial TNF&#x003b1; effects. In view of the fact that the treatment of HCV-associated vasculitis is largely empirical, this alternative therapeutic approach might be of particular clinical relevance. Indeed, the current standard therapy is antiviral treatment with peg-inteferon plus ribavirin without use of systemic immunosuppressive agents <xref rid="pone.0113351-Cacoub2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113351-Saadoun1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>; for MC, a therapy with Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the CD 20 antigen expressed on B cells, can be considered in patients with severe clinical manifestations including vasculitis, glomerulonephritis or neuropathy <xref rid="pone.0113351-Pietrogrande1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that endothelial cells actively participate in immune mediated vascular inflammation caused by viral infections. Activation of the pattern-recognition receptor TLR3 by HCV-RNA and poly (I:C) induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules and might thereby directly contribute to viral disease-associated vasculitis. TNF&#x003b1; adds significantly to the proinflammatory effects of viral RNA on endothelial cells. In vivo, poly (I:C) enhances leucocyte adhesion and transmigration, an effect which seems to selectively depend on subtype specific signalling of TNF&#x003b1; via TNFR2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113351.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
