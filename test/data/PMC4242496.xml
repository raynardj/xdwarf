[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Gastric cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy often diagnosed at an advanced stage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the decline in incidence and the major improvements in diagnosis and treatment, it remains the fourth commonest malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer are determined by multi factors including Helicobacter pylori infection, activation of oncogenic pathways and epigenetic elements
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Genes and molecules participating in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer, such as growth factors and their receptors, cell-cycle regulators, cell-adhesion molecules and matrix-degrading enzymes, etc. are all considered as important determiners of prognosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is desirable to identify useful biomarkers from these factors for diagnosing, stratifying, targeting gastric cancer and, ultimately, improve the survival of patients.</p><p>In the past two decades, great effort was made in search of reliable biomarkers to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. By employing genomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches, almost all genes and molecules participating in cancer growth, invasion and metastasis have been investigated as potential gastric cancer biomarker. However, few of these initially promising biomarkers have been validated for clinical use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The main challenge in identifying reliable biomarkers is the individual genetic variation and tumor heterogeneity, many aspects of which remain unknown yet
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other challenges include: the gene expression and protein products depend much on the cross talk of cancer cells, the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches are often too complex and expensive to be applied in clinic at present time and biomarkers generated by such strategies are out of context of cancer cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a new class of molecules termed aptamer has emerged as excellent molecular probes for cancer diagnosis and targeting therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA typically generated by an iterative screening process termed Systemic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The SELEX procedure involves progressive purification from a combinatorial library of nucleic acid ligands with a high affinity for a particular target by repeated rounds of partitioning and amplification
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In comparison with other molecular recognition elements, aptamers have the ability to bind specifically to a wide variety of targets ranging from small organic molecules to proteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The basis for target recognition is the tertiary structures formed by the single-stranded oligonucleotides
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, aptamers possess numerous advantageous characteristics, including small size, lack of immunogenicity, easy and reproducible synthesis, high binding affinity and molecular specificity, fast tissue penetration and low toxicity, tenability in binding affinity, and long-term stability
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To generate cancer specific aptamers in context of cancer cells, an approach termed whole live cell based SELEX (live cell-SELEX) has been developed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Accumulating evidences demonstrated that the live cell-SELEX is simple, fast, straightforward, reproducible, and most importantly, effective even when there is only a minor difference between a cancerous cell and an untransformed cell of the same tissue type
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus far, a group of cancer specific aptamers were generated by using live cell-SELEX, some of them have been successfully used for cancer detection and targeting therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].We have developed a gastric cancer specific DNA aptamer cy-apt 20 by employing live cell-SELEX. A series of experiments confirmed that, aptamer cy-apt 20 had higher than 70% of binding rate to gastric cancer cells and less than 30% of binding affinity to non-gastric cancer cells (unpublished data, see Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B). The results indicated that the aptamer cy-apt 20 has great potential to be used for the management of gastric cancer. The aim of the current study was to determine the feasibility of using cy-apt 20 as a molecular probe for detecting and targeting gastric cancer.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Briefly, before the selection, culture cells were washed twice with washing buffer (4.5&#x000a0;g/L glucose and 5&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate buffered saline with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride) (Sigma). 200 pmol of library or DNA pool was dissolved in 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of binding buffer (500 nM/L). The binding buffer was prepared by adding 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml tRNA (Sigma) and 1&#x000a0;mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) into washing buffer. The library or DNA pool was denatured and incubated with 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> AGS cells at 4&#x000b0;C on rocker for 40&#x000a0;min.

The cells were then centrifuged at 14000&#x000a0;rpm for 5&#x000a0;min. The supernatant containing the ssDNA was recovered and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using FITC- and biotin-labeled primers. Amplifications were carried out in an Eppendorf PCR thermocycler (Eppendorf GAC 22331, Hamburg, Germany). The selected sense ssDNA strands were separated from the biotinylated antisense ssDNA strands by alkaline denaturation and purified by streptavidin-coated sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The selected ssDNA was then dried and resuspended in binding buffer for the next round of selection. After eight rounds of selections, the final selected ssDNA pool was PCR-amplified and cloned into Escherichia coli using the TOTO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A large number of useful aptamers generated by this method are applied in the study of tumor biology, and even in diagnosis and targeting therapy of cancers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The encouraging results obtained with aptamers combined with their intrinsic properties and the versatility of the live cell-SELEX procedure have inspired us to employing this method to develop gastric cancer specific DNA aptamers. In our study, human gastric carcinoma AGS cell was used as target cell for positive selections and human normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cell was used as negative cell for counter selections. Through twelve rounds of successive selections, a pool of ssDNA containing sequences with higher binding affinity to the target cells has been enriched. By cloning and sequencing, we identified an ssDNA sequence from the final ssDNA pool named cy-apt 20 as potential gastric cancer specific aptamer (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Compared experiments subsequently demonstrated that cy-apt 20 had higher than 70% of binding rate to AGS cells and less than 30% of binding affinity to non-gastric cancer cells (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). The data (unpublished yet) indicated that cy-apt 20 may be a useful tool for detecting and targeting gastric cancer.</p><p>In the present study, we were to determine the feasibility of using cy-apt 20 as a molecular probe for detecting gastric cancer. The binding affinity and stability of cy-apt 20 in recognition of AGS cells were first assessed by binding assay in dose and time length changing manners, as a molecular tool for detecting target cancer cells must possess tenable binding affinity and stability in addition to high specificity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Equivalent library ssDNA were used as controls at the same conditions of cy-apt 20. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cy-apt 20 had higher than 78% of maximal binding rate to gastric cancer cells, much higher than that of non-gastric cancer cells. The fluorescence intensity of AGS cells was steadily increased after 40&#x000a0;min of incubation with increasing concentrations of FITC-cy-apt 20 and peaked at the concentration of 400 nM (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A-B). So was the fluorescence intensity of AGS cells increased by increasing the time length of incubation with 400 nM of FITC-cy-apt 20, peaked at the time point of 40&#x000a0;min, and lasted for a period of time longer than 50&#x000a0;min (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C-D). The results demonstrated that targeting recognition can be established by using minimal dose of cy-apt 20 and lasted for a period of time long enough for detections.</p><p>To further ascertain the feasibility of using aptamer cy-apt 20 for detecting gastric cancer cells in vitro, fluorescence imaging was performed in comparison with non-gastric cancer cells. Because a best biomarker based diagnosis must be produced in direct, simplified and visualized ways

In the compared examination, AGS cells were incubated with 400 nM of FITC-labled cy-apt 20 for 40&#x000a0;min, both human hepatocellular carcinoma cell HepG2 and colon carcinoma cell SW620 were used as controls. After incubation, the stained cells were viewed with an invert fluorescence microscope. The imaging showed that most of the AGS cells were stained by FITC-labled cy-apt 20 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>Ea), whereas, few HepG2 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>Eb) and SW620 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>Ec) cells were stained by FITC-labled cy-apt 20. The fluorescence intensity of AGS cells was approximately seven folds of that of HepG2 and SW620 cells (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). The results further indicated that cy-apt 20 may be a useful molecule tool for detecting and targeting gastric cancer cells.Next, a mice xenograft model was established to determine the feasibility of using cy-apt 20 for detecting gastric cancer in vivo. AGS cells were subcutaneously injected into the left axillary regions of BALB/c nude mice and both HepG2 and SW620 were transplanted as controls. 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of physiological saline containing 1 nM of cy-apt 20 labeled with Cy5 was injected via tail vein for in vivo imaging when the tumor grown visible for the assessment. Equivalent Cy5-labled Lib ssDNA was also used as control (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). In vivo imaging showed that there was no fluorescence signal detectable in all tumor sites 60&#x000a0;min after the injection of Cy5-labled Lib ssDNA. Strong fluorescence signals were detected in AGS tumor site after the injection of Cy5-labled cy-apt 20, whereas, no fluorescence signal was detected in either site of HepG2 or SW620 tumors. The fluorescence signals of AGS tumors imaged using Cy5-labled cy-apt 20 was approximately five folds of that of controls (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).The efficacy of using aptamer cy-apt 20 in detecting gastric cancer in vivo was also assessed in dose and time length changing manners. Strong fluorescence signals were detected after injection of 0.25 nM cy5-labeled cy-apt 20, increased by increasing the concentration of cy5-labeled cy-apt 20, and peaked at 1.25 nM (arrow notified) (Figure&#x000a0;
