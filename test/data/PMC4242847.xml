Observational studies associate proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and CDI incidence. We hypothesized that PPI use affected the distal gut microbiome over time, an effect that would be best explored by time-longitudinal study of healthy subjects on PPI in comparison to treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CDI subjects. This study enrolled nine healthy human subjects and five subjects with treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CDI. After random assignment to a low (20&#x000a0;mg/day) or high (2&#x000d7; 20&#x000a0;mg/day) dose group, fecal samples were collected from the nine healthy subjects before, during, and after 28&#x000a0;days of PPI use. This was done in conjunction with pre-treatment fecal collection from CDI subjects. High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA) was performed on time-longitudinal samples to assess changes to the healthy gut microbiome associated with prolonged PPI usage. The healthy samples were then compared to the CDI subjects to explore changes over time to the gut microbiome associated with PPI use and potentially related to CDI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report that PPI usage at low and high dosages, administered for 28&#x000a0;days, resulted in decreases to observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts after both 1&#x000a0;week and 1&#x000a0;month. This decrease resulted in observed OTU levels that were similar to those found in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CDI patients, which was partly reversible after a 1&#x000a0;month recovery period. We did not detect a dose-dependent difference in OTU levels nor did we detect significant changes in taxa previously reported to be affected by PPI treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While our observation of diminishing observed OTU counts during PPI therapy is a preliminary finding in a small cohort, our hypothesis that PPIs disrupt the healthy human gut microbiome is supported in this group. We conclude that decreases in observed species counts were reversible after cessation of PPI usage within 1&#x000a0;month. This finding may be a potential explanation for the association between prolonged PPI usage and CDI incidence.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Proton pump inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Gut microbiome</kwd><kwd><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are potent inhibitors of gastric acid production that are highly effective for treating acid-mediated disorders of the upper digestive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PPIs are one of the most commonly prescribed medications in the USA, with billions of dollars in annual sales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although they have a long history of safety and efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], epidemiological studies have linked PPIs to several nutritional, metabolic, and infectious disorders. Specifically, their prolonged use has been associated with iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and vitamin B12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] deficiencies, hypomagnesemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], osteoporosis-related fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and community-acquired pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, several recent studies have found an association between the use of PPIs and the development of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 39 studies reported a 1.74-fold increase in risk of CDI in PPI users (95% confidence interval 1.47-2-05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This association with the most common healthcare-acquired infection led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require that the package insert for PPIs contain a warning that PPIs may increase the risk of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite this epidemiological association, the reason why PPIs might increase CDI risk is not known. Although hypochlorhydria increases susceptibility to enteric bacterial infections, <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores are unaffected by gastric acidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The intestinal microbiota play an important function in suppressing pathogen growth (i.e., colonization resistance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and alterations in the microbiota by PPIs may induce <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation. The loss of colonic microbial diversity is a characteristic feature of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Microbiome analysis of the feces has been shown to improve the ability to distinguish CDI status when comparing cases with both diarrheal and non-diarrheal controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Prolonged use of PPIs has been linked to changes in the microbial community composition of the upper intestinal tract <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Gastric acid reduction may also influence the microbial composition of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The longitudinal changes in the gut microbial ecology during and after PPI use and how these relate to the microbiota present in CDI remain unknown.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of short- and long-term PPI use on the fecal microbiota and to compare these changes to persons with newly diagnosed CDI. If similar, it would provide a potential mechanism for the association of PPIs with an increased risk of CDI. Changes to the fecal microbial community induced by PPI use were assessed in healthy humans using high-throughput 16S hypervariable tag sequencing and compared to patients with a treatment-na&#x000ef;ve first episode of CDI. Our results demonstrate that microbial diversity declines following prolonged (28-day) PPI usage. This decrease results in observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels that are similar to those found in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CDI patients. The reduction in observed OTU levels was not always reversible 1&#x000a0;month after ceasing treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Ten healthy volunteers (five women, five men) were randomly assigned to receive omeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg once daily (<italic>n</italic> =5) or twice daily (<italic>n</italic> =5) for 28&#x000a0;days.

While limited by a small sample size, we observed that PPIs induce a marked and persistent decrease in observed OTU count, a surrogate for microbial diversity. At the end of the 28-day treatment period, the observed OTU counts were similar to those from patients with a first CDI episode indicating the potential for PPIs to negatively influence the robustness of the host microbial ecology and increase the susceptibility to CDI.</p><p>This is the first study to examine the impact of PPI use on the human gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings are consistent with past longitudinal studies of the GI microbiome that indicate stable individual microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. That is to say, despite the effects of PPI use, samples from the same subject taken over time remained more similar to each other than to the samples obtained from the other healthy subjects. In our work, this is supported by the unweighted UniFrac &#x003b2;-diversity distance matrix (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) showing clusters comprised of individual samples. NMDS plots also show minimal movement of individual samples over time, despite the overall reduction in diversity over time with PPI use.</p><p>Garcia-Mazcorro et al. showed that PPI usage in canines resulted in an increase of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. in male (<italic>n</italic> =4) and female dogs (<italic>n</italic> =4) and a decrease in <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas</italic> in the male dogs only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In contrast, our comparison of taxa highlighted in Garcia-Mazcorro et al. revealed no significant differences during PPI treatment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S5). The lack of taxa-specific associations in our human cohort may be due to the larger baseline differences that arise due to differences in age, environment, diet, and starting microbiomes, effects that are more difficult to overcome with small sample sizes. This variability can be observed in changes of relative abundance of taxa over time that varies between subjects (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S6). Garcia-Mazcorro et al. also collected mucosal biopsy samples from the stomach and duodenum of the dogs, reporting a decrease in <italic>Helicobacter</italic> spp. and a corresponding increase in the relative abundance of other bacteria in the stomach. However, in the duodenum, an overall increase in the abundance of all bacteria (i.e., small bowel bacterial overgrowth) was seen. Garcia-Mazcorro et al. did not report major qualitative changes in the phylogenetic composition of stomach and duodenal microbial communities after PPI use. A limitation of our study is that, given the complexities and expense of obtaining specimens from the upper GI tract, we did not evaluate the upper gut microbiota, an area of particular interest given the proximity to the acid-producing stomach. Further study in this area is needed.</p><p>Kanno et al. administered omeprazole to mice and found dose-dependent changes in fecal microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In contrast to the study of Garcia-Mazcorro, they found a higher abundance of all groups of fecal bacteria with the exception of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> during omeprazole use. Because it is unlikely that omeprazole reaches the colon intact, it was speculated that the microbial changes observed in the feces relate to an increase in bacterial load entering the colon or to changes in dietary protein reaching the colon given the role of gastric acid in the early stage of protein digestion.</p><p>Direct effects of PPIs on gut microbes may provide an explanation for the observed changes to community structure and species diversity during treatment, and may also provide a potential mechanism whereby PPIs increase the risk of CDI. Bacterial counts of many species increase in the setting of gastric hypochlorhydria. In contrast, omeprazole can inhibit the growth of many gut microbial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Loss of microbial diversity is a consistent feature in CDI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and animal models of antibiotic-mediated CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> antibiotic treatment leads to an increase in gut sialic acid, a favored catabolite of <italic>C. difficile</italic> whose availability is strongly associated with <italic>C. difficile</italic> bacterial load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The published literature provides strong evidence for the role of nutrient competition between the gut microbiome and <italic>C. difficile</italic> in utilization of available amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], monomeric glucose, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Although disruption of a healthy gut microbiome can create an environment conducive to <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation, the specific changes in host and microbial factors that directly lead to <italic>C. difficile</italic> invasion in humans remain unclear.</p><p>In addition to eliminating nutrient competitors, PPI use may directly affect gene expression across metabolic pathways in favor of <italic>C. difficile</italic> growth. We detected a significant decrease in enrichment of the KEGG pathway &#x0201c;glycine-serine-threonine metabolism&#x0201d; in CDI subjects compared to the healthy subjects. This pathway combines the synthesis of threonine and serine from separate pathways and the final production of glycine from either amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Glycine is a well-known enhancer of <italic>C. difficile</italic> spore germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Glycine and threonine supplementation has been shown to increase <italic>in vitro</italic> bacterial load and together lead to markedly increased <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Given these effects, the reduction of enrichment of glycine-serine-threonine in CDI is unexpected, and future work may attempt to directly quantitate amino acid concentrations in the gut in CDI subjects and GI-healthy subjects. The lack of significant changes in enrichment of this pathway in healthy subjects is expected given the lack of adverse effects reported by the healthy subjects. Further study is warranted to investigate the premise that PPI use can alter production of metabolites that serve as <italic>C. difficile</italic> germinants, growth factors, and toxin production enhancers.</p><p>Specific bile salts and glycine act as co-germinants of <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores, converting them to vegetative (infectious) forms. <italic>In vivo</italic> and independent of <italic>C. difficile</italic>, glycine appears to alter the ratio of deconjugated (primary bile salts) to conjugated (secondary bile salts) in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, secondary bile salts such as deoxycholate prevent vegetative growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. After severe disruption of gut microbial populations by PPI-induced hypochlorhydria, secondary bile salts are significantly reduced, allowing unrestricted vegetative growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Chenodeoxycholate, a primary bile salt, inhibits germination and protects the small intestine by inhibiting production of vegetative forms, until spores reach the anaerobic environment of the large bowel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. These conditions are reversed by cholestyramine, which binds bile salts that stimulate spore germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The direct effect of PPIs on <italic>C. difficile</italic> can be divided into effects on spore germination, effects on growth, and effects on toxin production. A recent report found that <italic>C. difficile</italic> spore germination in gastric contents was increased by nutrient supplementation as opposed to PPI use but did not compare germination efficacy with and without PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. No research is currently available to describe the effect of PPI on <italic>C. difficile</italic> spore germination or vegetative growth, but PPIs have a notable effect on toxin production of vegetative <italic>C. difficile. In vitro</italic>, some strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> possess enhanced toxin production in the presence of omeprazole, independent of final pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Strain-level variations in enhanced toxin production of omeprazole are likely to be an explanation of why PPI use is not as strongly associated with CDI as other well-known risk factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that PPI use in humans reduces microbial diversity, a condition found in subjects with CDI. A follow-up study with a greater number of recruited subjects will improve our confidence in this finding, a necessary precursor to future studies. Further investigation into the role of PPIs in altering metabolism in gut bacteria is likely to solidify our understanding of PPI-mediated changes within the gut microbiome and provide additional insight into the association between prolonged PPI usage and CDI acquisition. Finally, additional research should be performed in an effort to mitigate the loss of microbial diversity consequent to PPI use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (#13-000180) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01822977).

Exclusion criteria for healthy volunteers included prior surgery altering the esophagus, stomach, and intestine; chronic daily use of medications affecting GI secretion or motor function; the presence of any GI-motility affecting systemic diseases or untreated psychiatric disease; and pregnancy. Use of the following medications was prohibited: antibiotics within 2&#x000a0;months of the start of the study, probiotics within 2&#x000a0;weeks, and chronic use of medications that alter gastric acid (PPI, histamine-2-receptor antagonists) or motility (prokinetic agents, narcotic analgesics, laxatives, anticholinergics, antidiarrheals).

PCR conditions were set to 95&#x000b0;C/3&#x000a0;min, 35&#x000a0;cycles of 98&#x000b0;C/30&#x000a0;s, 70&#x000b0;C/15&#x000a0;s, 72&#x000b0;C/15&#x000a0;s, and finally 72&#x000b0;C/5&#x000a0;min in a Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler. PCR product sizes were verified using Agilent Tapestation with reaction cleanup and DNA was purified using an epMotion automated system (Eppendorf) with Agencourt AMPure PCR Purification System. Final quantitation was performed using QuBit HS dsDNA kit using the QuBit 2.0 flurometer (Life Technologies). Samples were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced on one lane of MiSeq at the Mayo Genomics Facility using MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;250 reads, 500-cycles) (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>NGS data analysis</title><p>Quality control of 16S reads can strongly effect ecological diversity metrics such as alpha- and beta-diversity, with filtering of low quality reads playing an important role in reducing the count of spurious OTU detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Briefly, after quality-filtering using Trimmomatic, paired 16S reads were de-replicated and singletons and chimeras were removed and clustered by similarity with representative sequence selection with USEARCH, part of the UPARSE package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Benchmarks by the author of the UPARSE package against mock OTU sets suggest that UPARSE better approximates actual species diversity due to its conservative nature. Representative sequences representing the OTUs were classified using Greengenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] 13_5 database with mothur 1.32.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Clean sequences were re-mapped to the representative OTUs using USEARCH. Output files were converted to BIOM format and processed using QIIME 1.7.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. An observed species rarefaction curve was generated to measure saturation of sequencing (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p>As the default Greengenes database did not possess <italic>C. difficile</italic> representatives, 72 sequences and appropriate taxonomy were downloaded from SILVA SSU r117 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] by searching the online version of r117 for &#x0201c;clostridium difficile&#x0201d; for non-repetitive reference sequences (Ref(NR)). The sequences and taxonomic data were concatenated to the reference fasta and taxonomy files, respectively. This supplemented Greengenes99 file was then used to re-classify the OTU representative reads from USEARCH in mothur using the classify.seqs function.</p><p>The R function sample was used to perform random sampling with replacement. The input used was a vector of incrementing values from 1 to a number equal to the total number of OTUs in the community matrix. For each sample, the probability of selecting any OTU was weighted by the relative abundance of that OTU in a particular sample. OTUs were then randomly selected 75,000 times for each sample, a value less than the read-count of the sample with the lowest read-count (75,506). The list of randomly sampled OTUs per subject was converted into a down-sampled community matrix by taking the randomly sampled OTU counts and incrementing the rows of a blank community matrix corresponding to the randomly selected OTUs.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of healthy and CDI datasets</title><p>SourceTracker estimates the proportion of a sampled microbial community that is derived from defined source communities. Previous uses include estimating the proportion of the microbiota detected at a variety of &#x0201c;sinks&#x0201d; from various environmental &#x0201c;sources&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. SourceTracker 0.95 from Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) was used on unrarefied data to determine the relatedness of various sink samples (T7, T28, T56) to sources (T0, CD). The mapping file previously used with QIIME was appended to include the additional columns required to designate sources and sinks. The healthy subjects and CDI subjects at baseline were used as sources, with healthy subjects at 7-days, 28-days, and 1-month post-treatment treated as sinks. SourceTracker performed rarefaction of 75,000 reads with ten restarts and 100 burn-in iterations. The percent relationship between the aggregate sinks and the aggregate CDI and T0 sources were plotted on a ternary plot constructed using the R package vcd.</p><p>NMDS was selected to analyze the between-sample distances of the community matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. NMDS uses rank-order of pairwise distances in a distance matrix and is a more robust technique for measuring relatedness of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. NMDS analysis was used to determine variation between CDI- and PPI-consuming subjects over time using a community matrix rarefied to 75,000 reads/sample. The R package vegan was used for NMDS calculations; specifically, function metaMDS was used to perform the NMDS calculation, followed by shape generation with ordihull and labeling of samples via orditorp. Shapes were generated based on sample group and time point, comprising CDI subjects, healthy subjects at baseline (T0), subjects after 1&#x000a0;week of PPI treatment (T7), 1&#x000a0;month of treatment (T28), and 1&#x000a0;month after ceasing PPI treatment (T56).</p></sec><sec><title>Diversity measures</title><p>Taking biom and tree files generated from UPARSE and mothur, data were converted to tabular form and analyzed using R-3.1.0 on R-Studio 0.98.

After rarefaction in QIIME, unweighted UniFrac &#x003b2;-diversity was calculated via beta_diversity.py in QIIME.

Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests were chosen to evaluate statistical significance of observed differences between datasets. Between healthy subjects longitudinally paired data, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank was used to evaluate if observed OTU diversity decreased during PPI use and was still lower than at baseline. The Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction was used to compare non-matched CDI subjects and healthy subjects at various time points. Wilcoxon rank sum was also used to compare high and low dosage groups and observed OTU counts between men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthetic metagenome prediction</title><p>PICRUSt was used to infer metagenomes from the 16S data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. From the 16S data we extrapolated gene content based on the evolutionary distance of a detected OTU to the closest relative with a completed reference genome. Very close evolutionary relationships to an organism with a closed reference genome would improve the confidence of predicted genome content, in contrast to OTUs with a closed reference genome only available from a distant evolutionary relative. The distances of all taxa to the nearest organism with closed reference genome were summed to derive the NSTI for each sample. OTU picking was re-performed in QIIME using pick_closed_reference_otus.py. The resulting biom file was then normalized using normalize_otus.py to convert the OTU content into KEGG gene content. Pathway annotation was generated using predict_metagenomes.py with the normalized biom file as input with default output using KEGG pathway information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. KEGG pathway data was then exported in tabular form to R-3.1.0 in R-Studio 0.98 for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Longitudinal changes</title><p>Evaluation of longitudinal trends was performed by transforming numeric counts per OTU into presence/absence (1/0) for each subject&#x02019;s four time points (baseline, short-term PPI, long-term PPI, post-PPI recovery). Absence (&#x0201c;0&#x0201d;) was strictly defined as no reads detected, with presence (&#x0201c;1&#x0201d;) defined as detectable reads per OTU for a given subject. For two outcomes and four time points, this resulted in 2<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1 combinations of an OTU after subtracting the combination corresponding to the absence in all time points (0000). From a rarefied community matrix of 75,000 reads per sample, the behavior of each OTU in each subject was classified into 1 of 15 bins corresponding to combinations of presence and absence at each time point (0001, 0010, 0100, 1000, 1111, etc.). The number of OTUs that were classified as belonging to each bin were calculated and plotted to assess the effects of PPI usage on multiple species per person.</p><p>Separately, longitudinal changes to relative abundance after commencement of treatment were calculated by taking the log10 transform of relative abundance per taxa at each post-treatment time point for each individual and dividing by the relative abundance of that taxa at baseline.

For transforms equaling negative infinity, the value was fixed at &#x02212;10.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>Sequences are available at NCBI SRA (SRA: SRP045730; BioProject: PRNJA259188).
