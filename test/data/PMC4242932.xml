electromyographic activities of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris
during knee isometric contraction. [Subjects] Fifty-two healthy young adults were enrolled
in this study. They were enrolled and classified into three groups by knee alignment
conditions: the genu varum, genu valgum, and control groups. [Methods] The
electromyographic activity ratio of the vastus medialis to the vastus lateralis and rectus
femoris were calculated using the percentage of maximum voluntary contraction. The
participants contracted their quadriceps during isometric contraction at 30 and 60&#x000b0; of
knee flexion. [Results] The genu varum group had more activity in the vastus medialis than
in the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris, whereas the genu valgum group had more
activity in the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris than in the vastus medialis. There was
a significant difference in the muscle activity ratio between the vastus medialis and
vastus lateralis by angle of knee flexion degree only in the genu valgum. There were no
significant differences in any of the three groups in terms of the muscle activity ratio
of the vastus medialis to the rectus femoris by angle of knee flexion. [Conclusion] The
quadriceps femoris was used for different strategies according to knee alignment during
isometric contraction at 30 and 60&#x000b0;. This study suggests that rehabilitation training
programs used to strengthen the quadriceps should consider the knee alignment conditions
of the target subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Quadriceps muscle</kwd><kwd>Isometric contraction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The quadriceps femoris affects the bones it attaches to and the joints it passes; it also
affects the alignment of the lower extremities. For instance, genu recurvatum is caused by
quadriceps weakness or stiffness<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; it is
evidence of the imbalances between the vastus medialis and lateralis by femoral torsion<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Genu varum and valgum are poor alignments
in the frontal plane. The quadriceps is concerned with movements in the sagittal plane, such
as knee flexion and extension<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; moreover,
the vastus medialis and lateralis, which cause medial and lateral pulling force,
respectively<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, may affect genu varum and
valgum.</p><p>Genu varum and valgum have a large affect on the alignment of the lower extremities. Genu
varum induces femoral retroversion, tibial medial torsion, decreased Q-angle, patellar
medial dislocation, toe-in, and subtalar supination, and so on. In contrast, genu valgum
induces femoral anteversion, tibial lateral torsion, increased Q-angle, patellar lateral
dislocation, toe-out, subtalar pronation, and so on<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many previous studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> have examined the quadriceps in relation to
femoral torsion, Q-angle, and patellar movement. However, there have been few studies
demonstrating the direct relation between the quadriceps and genu varum or valgum.
Therefore, an EMG analysis of the quadriceps by knee alignment is needed.</p><p>Sogabe et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> measured quadriceps cross
sections using MRI by knee alignment. The results showed that the genu varum group had a
larger vastus medialis than vastus lateralis, whereas the genu valgum group had a larger
vastus lateralis than vastus medialis. Tsakoniti and Stoupis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> studied quadriceps cross sections by Q-angle and reported that
people with a smaller Q-angle had a larger vastus lateralis than people with a larger
Q-angle. These studies demonstrated significant correlation between knee alignment and
quadriceps cross sections. The size of the cross section is related to the muscle length;
moreover, it can be easily inferred that both genu varum and genu valgum are related to an
imbalance in muscle power between the vastus medialis and lateralis. These muscles pull on
the patella, and an imbalance between these muscles causes the patella to move in an
abnormal direction; this could cause secondary musculoskeletal problems.</p><p>Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a disease in which the patellar medial pulling force is
weakened due to a weak vastus medialis and the patella is dislocated laterally, so it causes
knee pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with this syndrome are treated with selective strength
training programs for the vastus medialis in order to decrease pain and treat the
disease<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a lot of research
has been performed to identify ways to improve the vastus medialis selectively<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the muscle imbalance between the
vastus medialis and lateralis could cause pain, and training programs to relieve the muscle
imbalance are needed if there are imbalances between these two muscles according to knee
alignment. There are some studies that have reported an imbalance between the vastus
medialis and lateralis; however, there have been no studies demonstrating quadriceps
activities using EMG by knee alignment. Therefore, analysis of quadriceps activities by knee
alignment is needed.</p><p>This study classified subjects by knee alignment into genu varum, genu valgum, and control
groups, and determined how genu varum or valgum affects the quadriceps during isometric
contraction of the knee. Moreover, it demonstrated whether knee alignment conditions
influence muscle imbalance. It also tried to suggest theoretical evidence for treatment and
prevention of secondary musculoskeletal problems, which could occur as a result of muscle
imbalance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study enrolled 52 healthy young adults with no history of orthopedic or neurologic
symptoms and no knee pain. They were classified into three groups by knee alignment; the

measure the electromyographic activities of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and
rectus femoris during isometric contraction. Surface EMG electrodes (Ag/AgCl 2223, 3M,
Seoul, South Korea) were attached to points at 50&#x000b0; relative to the femoral longitudinal axis
and over 5&#x02005;cm from the superomedial patella for the vastus medialis, which is the diagonal
direction of the lateral 15&#x000b0; of midline at 3 to 5&#x02005;cm above the patella for the vastus
lateralis. The ground electrode was attached to a point on the skin above the tibial
tuberosity at 6 to 12&#x02005;cm from the inferior patella<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sample rate for the EMG signal was set at 1,024&#x02005;Hz, and it was filtered using a 13 to
430&#x02005;Hz band-pass filter and a 60&#x02005;Hz notch filter. The collected EMG signals were calculated
as the root-mean-square and then quantified.</p><p>Muscle activities were determined using the ratio of muscle activity at each motion by
maximum voluntary isometric contraction during isometric contraction. Then, each muscle
activity was measured during isometric contraction at 30 and 60&#x000b0; of knee flexion. Data were
collected for 5 seconds, and data for 3 seconds, except for the first and last 1 second,
were analyzed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle activities were
measured three times at each angle of knee flexion during isometric contraction; then, the
mean value was used and analyzed.</p><p>The electrographic activity ratio of the vastus medialis to the vastus lateralis was
calculated as the standardized amplitude of the vastus medialis divided by the standardized
amplitude of the vastus lateralis. Likewise, the electrographic activity ratio of the vastus
medialis to the rectus femoris was calculated as the standardized amplitude of the vastus
medialis divided by the standardized amplitude of the rectus femoris<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze quadriceps activities according to the knee
alignment conditions. Tukey and Duncan post hoc tests were converted as rank cases; hence, a
one-way ANOVA was used. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW version 18.0 for
Windows, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate significant
differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant differences in the activity ratio of the vastus medialis to the

1, the muscle activity of the vastus medialis is larger than that of the vastus lateralis;
if the ratio is less than 1, the muscle activity of the vastus lateralis is larger than that
of the vastus medialis. According to the results of this study, the ratio was over 1 in the
genu varum group, and moreover, the activity of the vastus medialis was larger than that of
the vastus lateralis. In the genu valgum group, the ratio was less than 1, and the activity

vastus medialis to the vastus lateralis during isometric contraction at 30&#x000b0; of knee flexion
were 1 in the control group, 1.3 in the genu varum group, and 0.7 in the genu valgum group.
At 60&#x000b0; knee flexion, the ratio were 0.9 in the control group, 1.2 in the genu varum group,
and 0.5 in the genu valgum group. These values were calculated as the electomyographic
activity of the vastus medialis divided by that of the vastus lateralis. Thus, if the value
was over 1, the muscle activity of the vastus medialis was larger than that of the vastus
lateralis. If the value was less 1, the muscle activity of the vastus lateralis was larger
than that of the vastus medialis. Therefore, the vastus medialis activity was larger than
that of the vastus lateralis in the genu varum group, while the vastus lateralis activity
was larger than that of the vastus medialis in the genu valgum group. Sogabe et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the cross-sectional ratio of
the vastus medialis to the vastus lateralis was approximately 1.2 in their genu varum group
and 0.9 in their genu valgum group. There are higher correlations between muscle strength
and muscle thickness<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>; thus, the results
in this study were similar to the results in the study of Sogabe et al<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Souza and Gross<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the muscle activity ratio of the vastus medialis oblique to
the vastus lateralis in people with patellofemoral pain syndrome. According to their
results, the muscle activity ratio of the vastus medialis oblique to the vastus lateralis in
people with patellofemoral pain syndrome was lower than that in the normal group.
Patellofemoral pain syndrome could cause genu valgum<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and therefore, this agrees with the results in this study, which
showed that the activity of the vastus lateralis was higher than that of the vastus medialis
in the genu valgum group. Therefore, this study suggested that the genu varum group had a
stronger vastus medialis, whereas the genu valgum group had a stronger vastus lateralis.
Genu valgum cannot be considered the same symptom with patellofemoral pain syndrome.
However, studies about the genu varum or the genu valgum related quadriceps were rare.
Because genu valgum increases the risk factors related to patellofemoral pain syndrome<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>,
studies concerning patellofemoral pain syndrome need to be considered.</p><p>The electromyographic activity ratios of the vastus medialis to the vastus lateralis during
isometric contraction were smaller at 60&#x000b0; of knee flexion than at 30&#x000b0; in all three groups.
This suggests that a larger knee flexion angle would result in higher vastus lateralis
activity; however, there was a significant difference only in the genu valgum group. As a
result, it was found that the genu valgum group had higher activity in the vastus lateralis
than the vastus medialis as well as a larger knee flexion angle. This study suggests that it
is more efficient for people with genu valgum to be trained through isometric contraction at
30&#x000b0; of knee flexion and for people with genu varum to be trained through isometric
contraction at 60&#x000b0; of knee flexion. Ninos et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the muscle activity of the vastus medialis increases
in accordance with increases in the knee flexion angle. Mariani and Caruso<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that people with patellar
subluxation showed higher activity of the vastus lateralis than the vastus medialis at the
end range on knee extension compared with their normal group. In the present experiment,
healthy adults without patellar subluxation or knee pain were enrolled; thus, investigation
of muscle imbalance by knee flexion angle is needed in people with orthopedic problems, such
as patellar subluxation caused by knee malalignment. Smillie<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the vastus medialis selectively fires in the last 10&#x000b0;
of knee extension and that it produces the last 10&#x000b0; of knee extension. Duffell et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the ratio of the muscle
activity of the vastus medialis to that of the vastus lateralis increased at the end of knee
extension at a speed of 30&#x000b0;/sec for knee extension. Although there were differences in the
types of muscle contraction or knee joint angles among these studies, they indicate that the
muscle activity of the vastus medialis increased as the knee flexion angle decreased; thus,
the results were similar to those of the present study.</p><p>There were significant differences in the electromyographic activity ratio of the vastus
medialis to the rectus femoris during isometric contraction both at 30 and 60&#x000b0;. Further, the
activity of the vastus medialis was higher in the genu varum group, whereas the activity of
the vastus lateralis was higher in the genu valgum group. These were similar to that of the
vastus lateralis.</p><p>There were no significant differences in the activity ratio of the vastus medialis to the
rectus femoris by knee flexion angle in the three groups. These results agree with those of
the studies of Signorile et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Han<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, who found that there were no
significant differences in quadriceps activity and knee flexion angle during isometric
contraction.</p><p>The limitations of this study included the number of subjects in the genu valgum group
compared with the genu varum and control groups, and the difference in general
characteristics, such as the mean height and weight, between the genu valgum group and the
other two groups, as the ratio of male was larger than that of females in the other two
groups. However, the electromyographic activity ratio in this study was compared between the
vastus medialis and vastus lateralis individually, not between individuals, so there might
be no difference depending on gender. Well-controlled subjects should be used in future
studies.</p><p>The results showed that the genu varum group had higher activity of the vastus medialis,
whereas the genu valgum group had higher activity of the vastus lateralis. More
specifically, the genu varum group had a weak vastus lateralis, whereas the genu valgum
group had a weak vastus medialis. Also, the vastus medialis in the genu valgum group showed
higher activity at 60&#x000b0; of knee flexion. Therefore, rehabilitation training programs
conducted to strengthen the quadriceps should consider the knee alignment conditions of the
target subjects.</p><p>In the future, studies will be needed to verify whether selective quadriceps strength
training programs that consider the knee alignment conditions of the target subjects can
prevent or treat pain or deformities caused by knee malalignment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Neumann</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group>: Kinesiology of the Musculoskeletal System: Foundations for
