Nucleic acid therapeutics require the delivery of highly negatively-charged nucleic acids from relatively low molecular weight siRNA to hundreds of times larger molecular weight plasmids. Although several groups including ours <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> have shown efficient nonviral delivery to tumor xenografts with siRNA, efforts with nonviral delivery of plasmids to tumor xenografts have been thwarted by inefficient delivery. If there was an efficient delivery system for plasmids, this delivery system might represent a transformation for treating tumors and be an important step toward successful &#x02018;gene&#x02019; therapy in the clinic.</p><p>Our laboratory has focused primarily on developing histidine and lysine peptide carriers with varied complexity to deliver plasmids <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Positively-charged lysines bind and protect DNA, partially neutralizing its charge <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, whereas histidines bind DNA, buffer endosomal pH and thus presumably aid in release of nucleic acids from endosomes. The development of linear and branched HK peptides by using solid phase synthesis has allowed the systematic modification of amino acid sequences and branching, providing ideal conditions for structure-function studies (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we found that linear peptides were ineffective compared to higher branch peptides as carriers of plasmids. Indeed, the four branch peptide, H2K4b, resulted in a transfection efficiency of malignant cells almost 6 logs greater than that of the linear peptide, H2K. Although the combination of liposomes and linear H2K synergistically increased transfection in primary nontransformed cells, the linear H2K by itself was still a poor carrier in these cells <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. These findings with HK peptides were dissimilar to those performed with linear poly(ethylene imine), which gave high transfection results <italic>in vitro</italic> and compared favorably to branch poly(ethylene imine) <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Because of the results from the <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection assays, we selected the branched peptide to deliver the nucleic acids <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our approach for selection of an effective carrier <italic>in vivo</italic> is similar to that of most other researchers in the nucleic acid delivery field: selecting an effective <italic>in vitro</italic> carrier for the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Moreover, the carriers <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> that show promise are often modified with polyethylene glycol and tumor-targeting ligands for studies <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of HK peptides.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jgm0016-0317-f1"/></fig><p>Although many effective carriers for studies <italic>in vivo</italic> have been identified based on results obtained <italic>in vitro</italic>, the development of nonviral carriers for clinical studies has still been painstakingly slow. One reason for the delay in the discovering promising gene delivery carriers may be the lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays that reflect results obtained <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the discrepancy between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays has been widely recognized, the exclusion of carriers based on their lack of efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> may result in not testing viable and effective carriers <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was the case with the linear H2K until recently. Very few nonviral studies have considered this potential problem <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and, to our knowledge, this has not been investigated for polyplexes.</p><p>In the present study, we compared the branch H2K4b carrier with what was considered to be the negative control H2K carrier for systemic delivery of luciferase plasmids to tumor xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic>. Surprisingly, transfection efficiency of tumor xenografts with the linear peptide, H2K, was significantly greater than with the branched H2K4b peptide. With biophysical methods including gel retardation and isothermal calorimetry, we then examined the properties and mechanisms of H2K polyplexes, particularly those with a reduced N/P ratio and negative surface charge, that enhance transfection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Female athymic mice (4&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;8&#x02009;weeks old, body weight; 20&#x02009;g) were purchased from NCI Frederick (Frederick, MD, USA).

Similarly, the effect of serum (10% FCS or mouse serum) on the stability of H2K and H2K4b polyplexes was evaluated by gel electrophoresis. After the HK plasmids (ratios &#x000bd; and 4/1) were prepared in OptiMEM and FCS was added (final 10% FCS) for up to 2&#x02009;h, the polyplexes were analyzed by gel electrophoresis.

Because the lung is the first vascular organ that the polyplex traverses after intravenous administration, we were particularly interested in comparing gene expression of the polyplexes in the tumor and lungs (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>a). The tumor to lung was higher at all peptide to DNA ratios with the H2K polyplex group compared to the H2K4b treatment group. Moreover, the gene expression in the tumor for the H2K polyplex was far greater than expression of luciferase in the lungs. By contrast, the lung expression was significantly greater than tumor expression of luciferase with the H2K4b polyplex. This difference in tumor to lung expression was particularly marked at the lower ratios where the HK polyplexes exhibited a negative zeta potential. In addition to the lung, other major organs showed lower expression than the tumor with the H2K polyplex (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>b).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Increased specificity of H2K polyplexes for tumor xenografts.

Several ratios of HK to plasmid (1/8 to 4/1) were used to compare tumor and lung luciferase expression from H2K or H2K4b polyplexes (a).

Immunohistochemical studies of luciferase indicated that H2K plasmid polyplexes were found to be widespread thoughout the tumor xenograft. By contrast, there was significantly less staining for luciferase in the tumor when the H2K4b polyplex was administered to the tumor-bearing mice. Immunohistochemical staining was repeated twice, confirming that luciferase expression was more intense and widespread throughout the tumor in the H2K plasmid polyplex group (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>a). To confirm this result and to examine whether the most intense luciferase staining was primarily located near the tumor blood vessels, double staining for vessels (CD31) and luciferase was performed (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>b). In addition to luciferase staining more intensely with the H2K polyplex group, immunostaining staining for this treatment group appeared to be uniform and, somewhat surprisingly, did not appear more intense around the tumor vessels. Lastly, we confirmed that H2K polyplex gene expression was higher and more widespread than that of the H2K4b polyplex by use of a fluorescent gene product (tdTomato). In place of the luciferase-expressing plasmid, the tdTomato plasmid in complex with H2K carrier similarly showed greater and more widespread gene expression compared to the H2K4b carrier (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>c).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Widespread expression of exogenous gene expression within tumor xenografts.

Four hours after the tumor-bearing mice were treated by injection with the HK polyplexes, the mice were euthanized. H2K polyplexes were consistently found at higher levels in the MDA-MB-435 tumor xenografts than were H2K4b polyplexes (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). Thus, higher transfection of the tumor by the H2K polyplex was the result, at least in part, of increased delivery. Increased background fluorescence in the lungs, liver and kidneys prevented determination of the amount of polyplexes accumulated in these tissues.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Enhanced delivery of H2K polyplexes to tumor xenografts.

At low peptide to DNA ratios, ITC shows a higher negative enthalpy for the H2K4b toward DNA compared to that of H2K (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). This indicates that H2K4b has a higher affinity for DNA. Similarly, on a weight by weight basis, H2K4b retards DNA in the absence and presence of serum (10% FBS) more effectively than does H2K (see Supporting information, Figure S4), indicating a higher affinity of the four-branched H2K4b for DNA. Further evidence that H2K has a lower affinity for DNA is suggested by the rapid degradation of its polyplexes when exposed to trypsin (data not shown) or supernatant from medium of cells (see Supporting information, Figure S5). We also determined whether NaCl could disrupt the formed HK polyplexes and release DNA. After exposure to NaCl (2. 5&#x02009;<sc>m</sc>), DNA was completely released from H2K polyplexes, whereas most of the DNA was retained with H2K4b polyplexes (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry of polyplexes.

Furthermore, the 4/1 ratio showed significant signs of degradation at the 4-h time point. By contrast, both ratios of H2K4b polyplex showed no evidence of degradation at the 30-min time point, and only the 1/2 ratio showed degradation at 4&#x02009;h. This is consistent with a loosely packed H2K polyplex compared to a more densely pack H2K4b polyplex. Thus, we then centrifuged polyplexes upon cells to decrease the transit time and exposure of the HK polyplexes to the enzymatic degradation of the medium. Centrifugation of H2K polyplexes increased transfection, particularly at higher w/w ratios, although transfection was still quite low (see Supporting information, Figure S6).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we determined that negatively-charged linear H2K polyplexes were far more effective for systemic plasmid delivery to tumor xenografts, despite their lack of activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The high gene expression and distribution throughout the tumor from H2K polyplexes represent major advances toward the use of plasmids expressing therapeutic genes or small hairpin RNA in the treatment of cancer. Because linear HK carriers <italic>in vivo</italic> have sufficient DNA binding for systemic transport of the polyplex to the tumor from an intravenous administration, yet still apparently enable rapid unpacking of the polyplex within the tumor, this encourages future studies aiming to examine a range of linear peptide structures that vary in length and sequence patterns. Because lysines and histidines interact with nucleic acids through ionic and non-ionic interactions, respectively, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, different patterns within the peptide are expected to affect binding affinity of peptide with the DNA, stability of the polyplex, and transfection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Although the most important result is this discovery of an effective plasmid delivery system for tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, the marked discrepancy between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with the two peptide carriers, indicates that new <italic>in vitro</italic> assays are required so as not to miss effective carriers. With H2K polyplexes, several <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection assays (e.g. reverse transfection assays, standard transfections with and without serum, and transfection of 3-D spheroids culture) were tested but they all failed, demonstrating only negligible to minimal increases in luciferase activity. Plasmid polyplexes of various sizes were also formed with H2K by varying the w/w ratio but, again, transfection results with small and large polyplexes were still quite poor. Centrifugation of H2K polyplexes, particularly larger ones, did increase transfection but only minimally, indicating that the relatively long transit time was not a significant factor bringing about differences between the polyplexes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although enzymatic degradation probably does not play a major role in reduced transfection <italic>in vitro</italic>, the sensitivity of H2K polyplexes to enzymatic degradation does indicate the presence of loosely packed polyplexes, consistent with rapid unpacking of H2K polyplexes within the tumor matrix.</p><p>We are unaware of studies in which systemically delivered polyplexes with a reduced N/P ratio (&#x0003c;1) giving a negative surface charge result in efficient transfection of tumor xenografts <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.

<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. With the addition of a surface steric layer (e.g. polyethylene glycol, alginate) and/or a tissue-targeting ligand, interaction of positively-charged polyplexes with the membranes may be less important, although it is still likely to have an auxiliary role in uptake <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>

Alternatively, negatively-charged nanoparticles in the presence of serum may have enhanced uptake because of the corona of serum proteins absorbed to the negatively-charged particles <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Not surprisingly, proteins absorbed to the negatively-charged gold particles were cationic, reducing the negative charge on the particle <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.

A recent study indicated that cationic polyplexes, particularly those less than 100&#x02009;nm in size, accumulated within the negatively-charged mesangium of the kidneys with subsequent degradation of the polyplex <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Whether biologically charged proteins disrupt H2K or H2K4b polyplexes with varied N/P ratios and modify their half-life is unknown, although pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies will help resolve some of these questions.</p><p>It is not clear why the mechanisms differed between linear H2K and branched H2K4b polyplexes in their accumulation and transfection of tumor xenografts. Although enhanced permeation and retention is a primary mechanism for the accumulation of polyplexes within tumors <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, this mechanism cannot readily explain the differences between the H2K and H2K4b polyplexes. Gene expression with H2K polyplexes in tumor xenografts was approximately ten-fold greater than H2K4b, whereas gene expression with H2K polyplexes in the lungs was two-fold lower. H2K polyplexes expressed luciferase in the tumor to a greater degree partly as a result of their increased delivery and pervasive distribution within tumor tissues. Although delivery differences between the polyplexes to the tumor were particularly relevant, the penetration and transfection efficiency of H2K polyplexes were still surprising in the tumor xenografts. The pre-injection size of the two polyplexes also cannot readily explain their differences in transfection of the tumor in that the H2K4b polyplexes were slightly smaller in size. Similarly, the surface charges of the two polyplexes were equally negative and thus cannot explain their distribution differences within the tumor. Although there is no direct evidence, we consider that greater penetration of H2K polyplexes within the tumor may be based on reduced binding of H2K with DNA. Reduced binding may augment greater penetration of the polyplex through its break-up into smaller components upon reaching the acidic tumor environment. Interestingly, a linear alanine-lysine peptide (A2K), which has reduced binding to DNA compared to the H2K carrier, is predominantly delivered with its DNA cargo to the lung, rather than the tumor tissue (tumor/lung approximately 1/14). The intermediate binding of H2K with DNA may explain why the H2K polyplex maintains stability within the bloodstream but releases DNA within the target organ.</p><p>There have been few studies to date that examined properties of nonviral polyplexes and correlations between their <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> transfection efficiencies. One investigation studied a large data set of lipidoids that varied in size, zeta potential, percentage encapsulation of siRNA, and specific cells transfected <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Although most properties were not predictive of an <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> correlation, the particular cell and percentage encapsulation did have predictive value. Moreover, the ability of <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection results to predict <italic>in vivo</italic> results increased markedly with pegylated forms of lipidoids. When pegylation (with or without ligand) of the nanoparticle leads to reduce transfection or silencing <italic>in vitro</italic> (as with HK peptides) <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, alternative assays such as molecular characterization assays that may be more predictive of effective carriers <italic>in vivo</italic> must be considered.</p><p>Although the substantial increase in transfection of tumor xenografts in a murine model with H2K polyplexes is likely to be multifactorial, we suspect that binding of H2K with DNA has a central role. Based on the reduced binding and disruption of H2K polyplexes into smaller polyplexes within the acidic tumor matrix (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>), the schematic shows one possible mechanism for the increased transfection of tumor xenografts by H2K polyplexes.

<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and their application to the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting may aid in the development of more effective carriers.
