Its coactivator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) strongly increases ATGL-mediated TG catabolism in cell culture experiments. To investigate the consequences of CGI-58 deficiency in murine macrophages, we generated mice with a targeted deletion of CGI-58 in myeloid cells (macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice). CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages accumulate intracellular TG-rich lipid droplets and have decreased phagocytic capacity, comparable to ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. In contrast to ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, however, CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages have intact mitochondria and show no indications of mitochondrial apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress, suggesting that TG accumulation per se lacks a significant role in processes leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Another notable difference is the fact that CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages adopt an M1-like phenotype in vitro. Finally, we investigated atherosclerosis susceptibility in macCGI-58/ApoE-double KO (DKO) animals. In response to high-fat/high-cholesterol diet feeding, DKO animals showed comparable plaque formation as observed in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In agreement, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of CGI-58 in LDL receptor<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not alter atherosclerosis burden in the aortic root. These results suggest that macrophage function and atherosclerosis susceptibility differ fundamentally in these two animal models with disturbed TG catabolism, showing a more severe phenotype by ATGL deficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>lipid droplets</kwd><kwd>storage diseases</kwd><kwd>comparative gene identification-58</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Monocyte-derived macrophages are present in virtually all tissues, where they remove apoptotic cells and cellular debris generated by tissue remodelling and/or cellular necrosis. Under pathophysiological conditions, macrophages play a key role during atherogenesis by internalizing modified lipoproteins or lipoprotein remnants that have invaded the vessel wall to form cholesterol-rich foam cells. This (along with other disease-related functions for this immune cell) has prompted profound research into the role of the macrophage, and how its functions are regulated during disease progression (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) is the coactivator of adipose TG lipase (ATGL), the major TG hydrolase for the initial and rate-limiting step in lipolysis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Lipolysis has been extensively studied in adipocytes, where under basal conditions CGI-58 binds to the surface of lipid droplets through interaction with perilipin1. Hormonal stimulation of lipolysis leads to phosphorylation of perilipin1 and hormone-sensitive lipase, resulting in the release of CGI-58 from perilipin1 to interact with and activate ATGL, which then converts TG to diacylglycerol and FA (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Both mice and humans affected with ATGL or CGI-58 deficiency suffer from systemic TG accumulation, a condition called neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) in humans (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Of note, specific phenotypical alterations are observed depending on whether ATGL or CGI-58 is defective. The most apparent difference is the severe epidermal skin defect observed in mice and humans with CGI-58 deficiency (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), which is absent in both species lacking ATGL (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This finding resulted in different classifications of the respective human diseases, namely NLSD with myopathy in ATGL deficiency (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), whereas CGI-58 deficiency leads to NLSD with ichthyosis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Several ongoing studies using tissue-specific CGI-58 and ATGL-deficient (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice aim at studying the proteins&#x02019; shared and individual contribution to lipid metabolism. In addition, functional differences observed in hepatocytes between mice with CGI-58 and ATGL deficiency argue for an ATGL-independent function of CGI-58 in this cell population (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and maybe other tissues as well (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Because CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice die shortly after birth due to a severe skin barrier defect (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), we generated myeloid-specific CGI-58 (macCGI-58)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to investigate the consequences of CGI-58 deficiency in macrophages. In the present study, we examined: <italic>i</italic>) whether CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages mimic the TG accumulation phenotype observed in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages; <italic>ii</italic>) whether CGI-58 deficiency affects macrophage function; and <italic>iii</italic>) whether the altered phenotype culminates in increased atherosclerosis susceptibility in macCGI-58/ApoE-double KO (DKO) animals. We have previously shown that loss of ATGL in macrophages affects macrophage phenotype and function, such as TG-rich lipid droplet accumulation, increased apoptosis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), reduced migration (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and decreased phagocytosis ability (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, transplantation of ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow into LDL receptor (LDLR)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed that the lack of ATGL in immune cells attenuates atherosclerosis susceptibility (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Being the coactivator of ATGL, we predicted that the absence of CGI-58 in macrophages leads to TG-rich lipid droplet accumulation. We hypothesized that loss of the ATGL coactivator CGI-58 in myeloid cells affects macrophage function in vitro and in vivo and impacts atherosclerosis susceptibility.</p><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals and diets</title><p>Mice with a targeted deletion of CGI-58 in myeloid cells (macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice) were generated by crossing CGI-58<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) (provided by Dr. Guenther Haemmerle, University of Graz, Austria) with transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase under the control of the murine M lysozyme promoter (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) (LysMCre, C57BL/6 background; provided by Dr. Thomas Ruelicke, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria).

To investigate the consequences of CGI-58 deficiency in macrophages, we generated a mouse model lacking CGI-58 exclusively in myeloid cells including monocytes, mature macrophages, and granulocytes (macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). These mice are viable with no apparent changes in skin phenotype. Compared with Wt mice, the lack of CGI-58 in myeloid cells does not affect body weight, lipid parameters, glucose levels, and glucose tolerance even when mice are challenged with WTD. Unchanged glucose tolerance in WTD-fed mice is contradictory to the results shown recently by Miao et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), who reported impaired glucose tolerance in high-fat diet-fed male macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This discrepancy is difficult to explain as both diets (WTD and high-fat diet) can be used to affect glucose tolerance. Because we have repeated the experiments in male mice that also lacked significant differences between the phenotypes (data not shown), a sex difference leading to the contradictory results can be excluded.</p><p>CGI-58 deficiency leads to decreased TG hydrolysis activity and a TG-rich lipid droplet accumulation in macrophages, identical to ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These results suggest that ATGL activity can be increased by CGI-58 as activator protein (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) also in macrophages. Unchanged CD36 and LPL mRNA as well as LPL activity argue against differences in FA uptake between CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Wt macrophages. Because LPL is responsible for the extracellular hydrolysis of lipoprotein-associated TG and the subsequent uptake of FAs in underlying cells and tissues, these results indicate that FAs generated by the action of LPL are taken up similarly by CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Wt macrophages. Unchanged TC and FC concentrations were associated with comparable CE hydrolase activities between Wt and CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, as observed in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In contrast to our results, Miao et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) found increased TC and FC concentrations and reduced CD36 mRNA expression in macrophages of male macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Whether the differences in the two studies are due to sex-specific differences or cultivation conditions of the macrophages (LPDS versus FCS) remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Measurement of FA composition within TG of CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages revealed increased concentrations of all saturated, unsaturated, and polyunsaturated FAs analyzed with the highest change in arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, respectively. FA composition has not been determined in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, but in white adipose tissue of ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Our findings are slightly different to these results (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), where the authors showed that ATGL hydrolyzes long-chain FA esters in vivo with a modest substrate preference for C16:1.</p><p>Fragmented mitochondria in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages are indicative of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway being triggered as a consequence of defective lipolysis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We expected the same phenotype in CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. Typical markers of programmed cell death, such as externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane measured by flow cytometry after annexin V/PI costaining, mRNA and protein expression of pro-apoptotic markers, and lack of fragmented mitochondria prior to cell death, however, revealed that mitochondrial apoptosis is not induced in CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. Absent CHOP protein expression and unaltered mRNA expression of the ER-resident chaperones Erdj4 and Pdi indicate that CGI-58 deficiency in macrophages does not cause ER stress. These results are different from findings in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, where we observed induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and ER stress (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interestingly, incubation of Wt macrophages with VLDL resulted in the same apoptotic phenotype and fragmentation of mitochondria as observed in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). From these results, we had initially concluded that intracellular TG accumulation is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and programmed cell death in macrophages. The results from the present work are therefore counterintuitive. Why TG accumulation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and VLDL-loaded Wt macrophages (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), but fails to affect CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, is elusive. Because ATGL is present in CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, it might be claimed that there is still basal ATGL-mediated TG hydrolase activity, which is sufficient to rescue the cell from mitochondrial apoptosis. However, macrophage TG concentrations are comparable between ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, suggesting other factors to be responsible for programmed cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages.</p><p>The in vitro phagocytic capacity was affected by the lack of ATGL (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and CGI-58 in a similar manner with reduced phagocytosis in glucose-containing and glucose-free medium compared with Wt macrophages. It has been demonstrated that hydrolysis of cellular TG by ATGL is necessary to produce FAs as ligands for PPAR activation and that ATGL deficiency leads to severely disrupted mitochondrial substrate oxidation and respiration (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although mRNA levels of PPAR&#x003b1; target genes in macrophages were unchanged, decreased mitochondrial respiration might contribute to the reduced phagocytic capacity of CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. Because the surface area of mitochondria was unaffected by CGI-58 deficiency, the reduced respiration is likely due to the decrease in FAs as energy substrate. A decreased OCR was also described in CGI-58-silenced RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Our in vitro finding of reduced phagocytosis could not be confirmed in vivo in macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, where we observed a trend to reduced phagocytosis, which, however, lacked statistical significance. We hypothesize that the reason for this discrepancy is the difference in the mouse models: in macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, CGI-58 is absent in myeloid cells including macrophages, in which phagocytosis is affected in vitro. In contrast, the decreased in vivo phagocytosis ability was demonstrated in whole-body ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Phagocytosis is a highly energy demanding process; reduced FA concentrations in ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) versus unaltered FA levels in macCGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might explain the observed in vivo changes in phagocytic capacity.</p><p>Due to the pronounced differences observed between ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, we were particularly interested in the impact of macCGI-58 deficiency on atherosclerosis susceptibility. Unexpectedly, plaque formation, number of macrophages, and collagen content was identical in aortic root sections of macCGI-58/ApoE-DKO and ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In line with these results, en face analyses of the aortic arch area revealed comparable lesion sizes in both genotypes. When we analyzed lesion per total area of the thoracic aorta, we found slightly increased plaque formation in DKO mice. In agreement, ASO-mediated knockdown of CGI-58 in LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not alter atherosclerosis burden in the aortic root, but very modestly increased atherosclerosis in the aorta. Collectively, these findings are again contrary to what we observed in the absence of ATGL, where transfer of ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow into LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in markedly reduced plaque formation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although different mouse models were used in these two studies, our results indicate that the absence of ATGL or CGI-58 in myeloid cells results in different phenotypes: reduced lesion development by ATGL deficiency and unaltered or even slightly increased plaque formation by lack of CGI-58. This difference in plaque formation is unlikely due to differences in cholesterol efflux capacities of the cells, because macrophages lacking either ATGL or CGI-58 show comparable cholesterol efflux as control cells. The M2-like polarization of ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages and the M1-like phenotype of CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> might contribute (at least in part) to the differences in plaque formation. In accordance with our results, Miao et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) have recently shown that macrophage CGI-58 deficiency activates the ROS-NLRP3 inflammatory pathway to promote insulin resistance in mice. We found increased IL-6 secretion from LPS-treated CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, suggesting that the lack of CGI-58 in macrophages affects the inflammatory response to LPS. This finding is in line with results from ASO-mediated CGI-58 knockdown experiments, in which lipid second messengers generated by CGI-58 were shown to be critically involved in maintaining the balance between inflammation and insulin action, thereby predicting a role of CGI-58 in cytokine signaling (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). On an ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background, however, plasma IL-6 concentrations and macrophage polarization markers were no longer different between mice that express or lack CGI-58 in macrophages. Because ApoE promotes macrophage conversion from M1 to the M2 phenotype (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), it might be speculated that the absence of ApoE directs macrophages into an M1-like phenotype, which cannot be further boosted by CGI-58 deficiency. In contrast, reduced plaque formation in aortic roots of LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice transplanted with ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow was associated with decreased macrophage IL-6 concentrations (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this study provide evidence that the TG-rich lipid droplet accumulation within ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages is likely not the reason for attenuated atherosclerosis development as initially hypothesized. Although loss of CGI-58 in macrophages results in comparable TG accumulation, several results were different between CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and ATGL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages: Absence of ER stress, mitochondrial apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as M1-like polarization of CGI-58<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, and differences in atherosclerosis susceptibility argue for different and/or additional function(s) of CGI-58 in macrophages beside activation of ATGL. We conclude that lack of the enzyme (ATGL) induces a more severe phenotype than loss of the activator (CGI-58).</p></sec>
