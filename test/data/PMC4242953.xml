Evidence of relationships between motor impairment and disability,
daily activities, and social participation following stroke has been reported. Motor
impairment at the time of hospital admission has been reported to be a good predictor of
physical disability after stroke rehabilitation. Chae et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated motor impairment, assessed using the Fugl-Myer
Assessment (FMA) Motor Impairment Scale, as a predictor of physical independence following
inpatient stroke rehabilitation, and reported that dependency in physical activities of
daily living was primarily determined by the degree of motor impairment. Independent walking
has been correlated with lower extremity strength<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, stroke rehabilitation focuses on the recovery of
impaired movement and its associated function<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>More attention has been paid to the evaluation of motor impairments in the upper
extremities than in the lower extremities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, despite lower-extremity motor functions
being frequently impaired following stroke and functional mobility deterioration<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This tendency also appears in the FMA
assessment, and the FMA, which is considered to be one of the most comprehensive
quantitative measures of post-stroke motor impairment, suffers from this drawback. The
psychometric properties of the FMA with regard to the upper extremities have been verified
through various analyses, and it is widely used to assess upper extremity function<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the FMA is commonly used in clinical trials to assess motor impairment and
determine treatment efficacy, no study has yet verified the psychometric properties of the
lower extremity subscales. Studies of FMA results for lower-extremities have not provided
separate data for this subscale<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The psychometric properties of the upper
extremity subscale, however, have been thoroughly established. Woodbury et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported on the dimensionality and construct
validity of the FMA upper extremity scale; we note that as a result, 3 reflex items were
removed, based on factor loadings and item infit statistics and a modified 30-item
assessment was recommended.</p><p>The existing research on the psychometric properties of the FMA has another limitation. To
date, most studies have employed heterogeneous samples, and the FMA&#x02019;s psychometric
properties may differ among subjects. More sophisticated methodology is needed<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, recent research has
investigated whether hierarchical properties of the FMA scale are the same in acute and
chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Choosing an appropriate measure is the foundation for planning an appropriate course of
therapy and assessing the effects of an intervention. Lower extremity motor function of
chronic stroke patients is important, and its improvement is a central aim of physical
therapy. However, evidence supporting the use of the FMA for lower extremity motor
impairment in chronic stroke patients is insufficient. Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to investigate the psychometric properties of the FMA-LE subscale for community-dwelling
hemiplegic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study followed a cross-sectional design. The sample was chosen from a group of
community-dwelling stroke patients visiting convalescence or rehabilitation centers for
disabled individuals in South Korea. Patients scoring 18 or below on the Korean version of
the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) were excluded from the study. Approval was
received from the ethics review board of our affiliated university. Informed written consent
was received from all the participants prior to their participation in the study.
Questionnaire responses and measurements of the 140 participants were analyzed; none had
missing data. Participants&#x02019; ages ranged from 42 to 86&#x02005;years, with an average age of
57.07&#x02005;years (SD = 9.88). Of the participants, 37.1% were female. The diagnoses included 66
hemorrhagic strokes and 74 ischemic strokes. The time since diagnosis of stroke ranged from
12 to 269 months, with an average of 50.48 months (SD = 47.06). The mean score on the MMSE-K
was 26.63, and ranged from 18 to 30.</p><p>We administered the FMA-LE, which consists of 17 items, with a maximum possible score of 34
points. Each item was answered using a 3-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = can
partially perform, 2 = can fully perform). The assessment was completed by trained
registered physical therapists.</p><p>Construct validity, response characteristics, item discrimination and internal consistency
were assessed. We employed factor analysis to identify unidimensionality. The suitability of
the collected data for factor analysis was examined using Bartlett&#x02019;s test of sphericity and
the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test. The KMO value was 0.918 and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> of
Barlett&#x02019;s test was 2,841.56 (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The criteria for determining unidimensionality
through factor analysis were as follows: 1) the scree plot shows one clear factor, 2) the
eigenvalue of this factor is significantly larger than those of other factors, and 3) this
factor explains over 20% of the total variance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We found that the collected data were appropriate for factor analysis. Item discrimination
was analyzed by calculating the correlations between items and total scores. We employed the
SPSS 20 for the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Factor analysis results are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

lower extremity subscale. Although the FMA is widely used to measure motor impairment and
recovery of stroke patients, the psychometric properties of the lower extremity subscale
have not been separately examined until now.</p><p>The 50-item FMA motor scale is a widely used assessment of motor function of both the upper
and lower extremities following stroke, and has been recommended as an outcome measure for
stroke rehabilitation<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless,
although the construct validity of the FMA has been reported in previous studies,
confirmation of unidimensionality of the FMA has only been reported for the upper extremity
subscale<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results verified the
unidemensionality of the FMA-LE, which suggests that the scale has a utility similar to that
of the upper extremity subscale.</p><p>The acceptable level of ceiling and floor effects is below 30%<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. We found no ceiling or floor effects, with the lowest
score percentage being 2.9% and the highest score percentage being 7.9%. Concern about the
FMA&#x02019;s ceiling effect was raised in a previous review<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, this effect has not been examined objectively. In the
present study, the FMA-LE showed no ceiling or floor effects in community-dwelling
hemiplegic stroke patients.</p><p>Although there is no absolute standard for judging item discrimination, correlations above
0.40, between 0.30&#x02013;0.40, and below 0.30 have been deemed to have high, moderate, and low
discriminant ability, respectively<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. If
items scored below 0.20, they were considered for removal in a previous study<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. We found that the FMA-LE item-total
correlations were all above 0.40.</p><p>The FMA-LE demonstrated high internal consistency. According to Nunnally and Bernstein<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, the classifications for the strength of
Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; coefficients are: poor = below 0.50, moderate from 0.50 to 0.75, good = 0.75 to
0.90, and high above 0.90. Our result for internal consistency was similar to the value of
0.96 found in the study by Duncan et al<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Methodological shortcomings related to a small number of subjects
being tested have been raised in previous research examining the reliability of the FMA<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our participants were 140 hemiplegic
community-dwelling patients. The present results suggest that the FMA-LE is a reliable
assessment tool for this group.</p><p>The FMA has been deemed to have appropriate validity and reliability; however, physical
therapists should bear its limitations in mind. Our results suggest that the FMA-LE can be
used as a separate assessment for measuring the motor impairment of community-dwelling
stroke patients with hemiplegia. Further studies should explore the various psychometric
properties among homogenous subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Tilson</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Cen</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Fugl-Meyer assessment of sensorimotor function after
