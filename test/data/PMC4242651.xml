Extraordinarily high bacterial abundance and biomass were fueled by the breakdown of a massive bloom of <italic>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</italic> after ice formation. A reduction in light resulting from snow coverage exerted a pronounced physiological stress on the cyanobacteria. Consequently, these were rapidly colonized, leading to a sudden proliferation of attached and subsequently of free-living heterotrophic bacteria. Total bacterial protein production reached 201 &#x000b5;g C L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, ca. five times higher than spring-peak values that year. Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis at high temporal resolution showed pronounced changes in bacterial community structure coinciding with changes in the physiology of the cyanobacteria. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that during breakdown of the cyanobacterial population, the diversity of attached and free-living bacterial communities were reduced to a few dominant families. Some of these were not detectable during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom indicating that only specific, well adapted bacterial communities can colonize senescent cyanobacteria. Our study suggests that in winter, unlike commonly postulated, carbon rather than temperature is the limiting factor for bacterial growth. Frequent phytoplankton blooms in ice-covered systems highlight the need for year-round studies of aquatic ecosystems including the winter season to correctly understand element and energy cycling through aquatic food webs, particularly the microbial loop. On a global scale, such knowledge is required to determine climate change induced alterations in carbon budgets in polar and temperate aquatic systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by the Leibniz Institute.

However, estimated biomass turnover for the overall bacterial communities from these studies usually ranges between 4&#x02013;10 days indicating that winter microbial communities are actively growing and not just dormant. Although seasonally ice-covered lakes are greatly understudied in the cold season, there is increasing evidence that winter dynamics of the lake's microbiome (prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms) is important for understanding bacterial community succession in the following ice-free period <xref rid="pone.0113611-Bertilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113611-Twiss1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Powerful molecular tools enable systematic explorations of the diverse and largely uncultivable bacterioplankton communities <xref rid="pone.0113611-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> including the winter season (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0113611-Tada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>).

These studies reveal a typical winter bacterioplankton community, which is distinct from that during the warm season indicating specific bacterial adaptation to environmental conditions in winter, e.g. little light, low temperatures and organic matter (OM) concentrations, and high inorganic nutrient availability during winter mixing and early ice cover stages.</p><p>Although lakes cover a little more than 3% of the Earth surface as compared to 71% by oceans and seas, they have an equal contribution to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <xref rid="pone.0113611-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and a larger contribution to carbon burial <xref rid="pone.0113611-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, it is surprising that annual studies of freshwater systems often neglect the entire period of ice coverage. Using a well-studied limnic system (Lake Stechlin, Germany), we present evidence for the quantitative significance of heterotrophic bacterial activity due to rapid mineralization of phytoplankton biomass in ice-covered aquatic systems. Our findings thus confirm and extend recent findings on the rapid sinking of under-ice phytoplankton blooms in the Arctic Ocean <xref rid="pone.0113611-Boetius1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we followed a sudden and massive under-ice proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria in oligotrophic Lake Stechlin following the breakdown of an under-ice bloom of the low light-adapted cyanobacterium <italic>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</italic> in March 2010. Based on this phenomenon during which OM became suddenly available at high concentrations in the cold season, we hypothesize that once winter conditions have reached a steady state, bacterial activity and community composition are mainly regulated by OM availability and subsequent protozoan grazing, and only to a lesser extent by low water temperatures as has been traditionally suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Field permit was granted to the Leibniz institute by the stechlin natural park authorities on a permanent basis.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Description of study site</title><p>Lake Stechlin (53&#x02032;09 N, 13&#x02032;02 E) is a seasonally ice-covered meso-oligotrophic freshwater lake formed after the last glacial period in northern Europe (Weichselian).

Upon selection, the system acquired a z-stack of 25 images around the focused position with an interval of 0.3 &#x000b5;m for each channel. For cell quantification, a maximum intensity projection was calculated on each channel.

Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing of pooled PA and FL fractions of both the epi- and hypolimnion showed that the transition between Phase I and II resulted not only from a change in the bacterial groups, as already implied by CARD-FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113611-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>; 4), but also from a strong decrease in the number of dominant bacterial families, and the expansion of a few groups of specialist bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113611-g006">Fig. 6</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113611.s004">S4</xref>). In Phase I, 50% of PA bacteria in the epilimnion belonged to 4 major families while the rest was distributed among 44 others.

This, together with our microscopic observations, indicates that solely a small fraction of cyanobacterial cell debris reached this depth, and that the cyanobacterial biomass was efficiently remineralized in the epilimnion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In temperate lakes, persistent cyanobacterial blooms frequently occur in winter under the ice (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0113611-Keto1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113611.s009">Table S5</xref>). However, most ice-covered (meso-) oligotrophic lakes such as Lake Stechlin have been considered to be low carbon environments in winter <xref rid="pone.0113611-Bertilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This is mainly because of two factors: 1) Primary productivity is usually low due to decreased light availability under the ice; 2) Input of atmospheric and terrestrial OM is blocked by the ice coverage and the available internal OM is rapidly consumed by the residual heterotrophic bacterial community. Accordingly, a low BPP was measured during Phase I of the cyanobacterial bloom. Coverage of Lake Stechlin with clear ice, however, allowed for penetration of sufficient light which together with a stable inverse (as compared to the summer) stratification of the water column sustained growth of low temperature- and low light-adapted <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113611-veges1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> in the cold epilimnion (&#x0003c;4&#x000b0;C).</p><p>Bacterial numbers and BPP remained low in Lake Stechlin in Phase I. At this time inorganic nutrients necessary for the blooming of <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic> were abundant after the mixing in early winter, including nitrogen as indicated by the lack of heterocysts and phosphorus by storage in form of poly-P granules. The high growth potential of the winter bacterioplankton - irrespective of temperature - became evident when <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic> became light limited <xref rid="pone.0113611-veges1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> due to low irradiance under the snow-covered ice in Phase II. The sudden increase in bacterial abundance and BPP in the epilimnion during the transition from Phase I to Phase II in parallel to the relatively high availability of inorganic nutrients support the hypothesis that the winter bacterioplankton in Lake Stechlin is controlled by carbon availability rather than temperature. The physiologically stressed cyanobacteria were rapidly colonized by heterotrophic bacteria that alone, or in combination with cyanophages degraded the <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic> filaments, leading to an extremely high bacterial abundance and BPP in Phase II. The degradation of cyanobacterial filaments resulted in the release of the protoplasmic content into the surrounding water leaving empty &#x0201c;ghost cells&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113611-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), thus increasing OM availability also for FL bacteria. Although temperature remained &#x0003c;4&#x000b0;C in the epilimnion in Phase II, high inorganic nutrient availability coupled to the relief from carbon limitation led to an extreme increase in BPP, which was &#x0003e;5 times higher than measured during the peak of the subsequent spring bloom <xref rid="pone.0113611-Rsel2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, BPP under the ice is in the same range as measured during summer blooms in four Swedish lakes despite the fact that the bacterial abundance under the ice was 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude lower <xref rid="pone.0113611-Eiler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. From this notion it is evident that periodical events such as the under ice <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic> bloom in Lake Stechlin lead to high microbial OM turnover in winter when concentrations of herbivorous zooplankton are low <xref rid="pone.0113611-Bertilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This suggests that availability of OM rather than temperature triggered BPP leading to a rapid mineralization of the phytoplankton biomass in ice-covered Lake Stechlin counter-acting its sinking and burial in the sediment. Thus, the rapid sinking of under-ice phytoplankton blooms in cold environments <xref rid="pone.0113611-Boetius1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> should be seen in an environmental context and should not be considered as a general rule.</p><p>It can be assumed that the high heterotrophic activities measured in Phase II have the potential to strongly affect C cycling, particularly the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from the lake into the atmosphere after ice-off. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations under the ice gas-barrier can exceed summer values <xref rid="pone.0113611-Kling1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> reaching concentrations of up to 650 &#x000b5;mol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and often 2&#x02013;3 folds higher than during the ice-free period <xref rid="pone.0113611-Kankaala1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Hence, the resultant CO<sub>2</sub> buildup can be rapidly released to the atmosphere upon ice-off. So far, under ice blooms of heterotrophic bacteria have been neglected for modeling of metabolism and element cycling in lakes. However, Karlsson et al. <xref rid="pone.0113611-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> suggest that up to 55% of the annual gas emission from freshwater systems occurs during ice-off. To better understand and predict environmental consequences of lake biogeochemistry, year-round studies are required to also include massive under ice blooms of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms. These may also set the frame for the subsequent food web development during the growing season <xref rid="pone.0113611-Bertilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>High availability of OM during bacterial colonization and lysis of <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic> cells also dramatically affected biodiversity reflected by a temporal shift in BCC. Our DGGE fingerprints suggest a sudden change of BCC between Phase I and II. The uniformity in quality of the available OM in Phase II of the bloom was indicated by the dominance of solely a small group of specialized bacteria different from those in Phase I. These bacteria first appeared in the epilimnic PA fraction and later in the FL fraction of the epilimnion and in the PA fraction of the hypolimnion. This suggests that a) bacterial colonization of senescent cyanobacteria resulted in detachment of bacteria and release of substrates into the surrounding water supporting the proliferation of these communities; b) a small fraction of colonized <italic>A. flos-aquae</italic> aggregates sank into the hypolimnion. The latter process was reflected by significant changes in BCC of hypolimnic PA bacteria greatly reducing microbial diversity in this fraction.</p><p>These shifts in microbial communities present a limnic under-ice analogue to the substrate-driven succession of marine bacterioplankton populations induced by phytoplankton blooms recently described by Teeling et al. <xref rid="pone.0113611-Teeling1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Although temperatures and salt content greatly differed between the two studies, the <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic> family, known to degrade high-molecular-weight OM <xref rid="pone.0113611-Kirchman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, were among the first to colonize the <italic>A. flos</italic>-<italic>aquae</italic> cells. Nevertheless, while the marine event harbored numerous genera from the <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> was the sole genus detected under the ice in Lake Stechlin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113611.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). In the marine analogue <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> and to some extent <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> succeeded the <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>. In contrast, in our study, <italic>Betaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113611-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), specifically members of the genera <italic>Undibacterium</italic> and <italic>Massilia</italic> as well as an unclassified group of <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113611.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) followed the initial colonization and rapidly exceeded the abundance of <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113611-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). We propose that the betaproteobacterial clades detected under the ice in Lake Stechlin fill in similar ecological niches in freshwater as the marine <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> associated with a decaying algal bloom in Teeling et al. <xref rid="pone.0113611-Teeling1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, both blooms independent of water temperature had a similar carrying capacity, leading to an increase in FL bacterial abundance from 0.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> to 3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. This maximal carrying capacity could be a result of a protozoan top-down control similar to that observed in Lake Stechlin.</p><p>In our study, available OM affects the BCC and BPP. While the temperature in the epilimnion remains constant &#x0003c;1&#x000b0;C throughout the period, and, therefore, can be excluded as an influencing factor. OM increases dramatically in Phase II due to cyanobacterial decay. Based on our DGGE results, the BCC remained stable during Phase I (for at least 2 months) in parallel to a rather stable BPP. Nevertheless, during the rapid transition between Phase I and II of the bloom, while temperature remained constant, we observed a major change in BCC accompanied by a large increase in activity. The initially low abundant <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic> in Phase I appeared in larger numbers in Phase II and the previously diverse <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> were reduced to 3 genera solely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113611.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). These phylotypes included cold adapted species such as <italic>Flavobacterium psychrolimnae</italic>, <italic>F. fryxellicola</italic>, <italic>F. limicola</italic>, <italic>F. omnivorum</italic>, <italic>F. frigidarium</italic> that are often reported from ice-covered aquatic systems <xref rid="pone.0113611-VanTrappen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113611-Humphry1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The bacterial phylotypes in Phase II grew rapidly and were able to degrade the cyanobacterial cells to a large extent. This suggests that availability of OM not only triggered BPP, but also succession in BCC.</p><p>Under-ice blooms of phytoplankton are not sporadic events since, during the last decades, they have been regularly described from limnic environments and more recently also from marine systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113611.s009">Table S5</xref>). Using Lake Stechlin as an example, we show that temperate lakes bear the potential for high biological activity even during the cold winter season. Despite the low temperature (&#x0003c;4&#x000b0;C), carbon flow from primary production and, particularly, from cyanobacteria biomass during bloom breakdown has the potential to fuel massive blooms of heterotrophic microorganisms. These were soon top-down controlled in the epilimnion by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113611-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), demonstrating that also protozoa growth was less dependent on water temperatures than on prey availability. Consequently, under ice blooms of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms greatly affect the lake's biogeochemistry and thus set the frame for further food web dynamics in the ice-free season.</p><p>Current climate change leads to a reduced intensity of ice coverage and hence to dramatic environmental changes with so far unknown ecological consequences, e.g., for biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas fluxes across the water-atmosphere boundary. Limnic systems are known to be super-saturated with greenhouse gases <xref rid="pone.0113611-Cole2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. While global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from freshwater have been estimated to 0.75 Pg y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0113611-Cole3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> (equal to oceanic emissions <xref rid="pone.0113611-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>), these estimates do not include emissions following ice-off. Sediments of freshwater systems store ca. 3 times more carbon (0.3 Pg y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than marine ones (0.1 Pg y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (&#x0223c;150 times more when normalized to area) <xref rid="pone.0113611-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Yet, this figure does not include the unresolved fate of massive under-ice blooms in seasonally ice covered lakes. With the exception of extremely oligotrophic lakes, most of the OM in limnic systems is of autochthonous origin <xref rid="pone.0113611-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the response of the heterotrophic bacterial community to massive under ice phytoplankton blooms potentially determines whether the lake acts as a C sink or a source. To better understand the role of lakes in global biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity throughout the whole season, it will be crucial to perform year-round studies with a greater focus on the winter season, which - independent of the low temperature - has the potential for high biological activities as long as phototrophic OM remains available for heterotrophic processing. Such studies should have a high temporal sampling resolution (as can be achieved by automatic sampling or monitoring) since as demonstrated in our study the entire bloom event can last less than two weeks. The short duration of such dynamic events points to the fact that monthly routine sampling is very likely to miss such events and that even in winter, boosts in biological activities and OM turnover occur. Extending earlier studies, e.g. those from Lake Baikal <xref rid="pone.0113611-Strakrbov1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, usually covered by clear ice, we here suggest that energy and substrate availability rather than temperature are the key factors controlling dynamics of aquatic microorganisms. The dimensions of these carbon driven heterotrophic blooms are important for understanding their present ecological role in aquatic ecosystems, particularly when taking into account that in the future sea ice will rapidly reside <xref rid="pone.0113611-Levasseur1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and perennially ice-covered aquatic ecosystems may fully disappear <xref rid="pone.0113611-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113611.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Oxygen concentration (A) and PH (B) profiles measured during winter 2010 in Lake Stechlin.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0113611.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113611.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Colonization density of particle-attached bacteria and abundance of free living cells.
