mobilization techniques combined with capsular distension for patients with adhesive
capsulitis (AC). [Subjects] The subjects were 53 patients with AC (mean age, 56.0 &#x000b1;
7.6&#x02005;years). [Methods] Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: intensive
mobilization after one steroid injection with capsular distension (IMSID); intensive
mobilization (IM); one steroid injection with capsular distension (SID); and general
physical therapy only (GPT). The IMSID, IM, and SID groups also received general physical
therapy for 20 minutes. All treatments were performed twice per week for 4 weeks. Patients
were assessed using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Constant-Murley
Shoulder Function Assessment Score (CS), Active Range of Motion (AROM), and Verbal Numeric
Score (VNS). [Results] There were significant post-intervention differences in all the
measured values in each of the groups, except for external rotation ROM in the SID group.
The IMSID group showed the greatest differences among the groups. There were significant
differences among the means of all the groups. [Conclusion] The most effective treatment
for AC was the combination of the intensive mobilization and steroid injection with
capsular distension, which helped to control inflammation, extend joint space, and recover
ROM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Adhesive capsulitis</kwd><kwd>Intensive mobilization</kwd><kwd>Capsular distension</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a shoulder condition characterized by gradual and painful loss
of both active and passive range of motion (ROM) in all planes of the glenohumeral
joint<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shoulder pain and stiffness are
accompanied by severe disability. Often, this results in absenteeism from work, inability to
perform leisure activities, and utilization of health care resources. Although it is
generally believed to be a self-limiting condition lasting 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;years, some studies have
reported that up to 40% of patients have persistent symptoms and stiffness beyond 3&#x02005;years.
Therefore, effective treatment that shortens the duration of symptoms and disability has the
potential to be of significant value in terms of reduced morbidity and costs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many treatments have been advocated for AC:
rest, analgesia, active and passive mobilization, physical therapy, oral and injected
corticosteroids, capsular distension, manipulation under anesthetic, and arthroscopic
capsular release. Currently, there is no consensus as to which is the most effective
treatment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical therapy following joint distension provides no additional benefits in terms of
pain, function, or quality of life, but results in sustained greater active range of
shoulder movement and participant-perceived improvement up to 6 months. Capsular distension
and subsequent intensive rehabilitation has a beneficial effect, and this combination
enables rapid, significant improvement from the first week onwards<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that general physical therapy plus
distension with intra-articular (IA) steroid injection is superior to physical therapy alone
for the functional improvement of frozen shoulder; however, the pain score difference was
not significant between the two groups<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The efficacy of AC treatment is still being debated. Steroid injection with distension is
currently recommended for the treatment of AC. It also has been demonstrated that a variety
of mobilization therapies show the same clinical outcome with less risk<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, the synergistic effect of an intensive
mobilization technique combined with capsular distension and steroid injection for AC in
improving pain, shoulder ROM, and shoulder function is unclear. Therefore, we conducted a
randomized controlled trial for 4 weeks, focusing on the effectiveness of an intensive
mobilization technique combined with distension for AC of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Using patient medical records, this study retrospectively analyzed treatment effects.
Patients with shoulder pain and limitation in motion visiting the outpatient rehabilitation
department were initially selected. The inclusion criteria of this study were as follows:
stage 1 or 2 AC, with a symptom duration of 3&#x02013;9 months, and difficulties in two or more of
the following: flexion, abduction, external rotation, and/or hands behind the body
presenting limitation of more than 30 degrees in active ranges of motion, compared to the
normal side with regard to range of motion<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Prior to participation, all participants were informed about the study&#x02019;s aims and
procedures, and signed in formed consent forms. This study conformed to the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Patients in the intensive mobilization after steroid injection with distension (IMSID)
group received an injection once before treatment was started. Under fluoroscopic guidance,
all patients received 40&#x02005;mg of triamcinolone, 3&#x02005;ml of 1% lidocaine, and 10&#x02005;ml of normal
saline given by the anterior route. All injections were performed by the same doctor of
rehabilitation medicine, who is well-trained. After injection, the IMSID group received
intensive mobilization therapy for 20 minutes which was performed by one physical therapist.
Specific intensive mobilization techniques included: 1) glenohumeral joint passive accessory
glides, including the Maitland mobilization technique (MMT)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, End-Range Mobilization (ERM)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and Kaltenborn&#x02019;s convex-concave gliding<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>; and 2) glenohumeral joint physiologic mobilization,
including Mobilization with Movement (MWM)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Intensive Mobilization (IM) was treated only with the
intensive mobilization technique. The Steroid Injection with Distension (SID) group received
only a single capsular distension at the times of steroid injection. The General Physical
Therapy (GPT) group received physical therapy for 20 minutes, which included moisture hot
pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasound diathermy. The IMSID, IM,
and SID groups also received general physical therapy for 20 minutes. At the beginning of
the intervention, participants were instructed to maintain their program of 10 minutes of
daily home exercise. All treatments were performed twice per week for 4 weeks.</p><p>Patients were assessed using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI),
Constant-Murley Shoulder Function Assessment Score (CS), Range of Motion (ROM), and Verbal
Numeric Score (VNS) before treatment and at 4 weeks, after the final treatment. The primary
outcome measure, the SPADI, is a self-administered assessment tool that assesses pain and
disability related to shoulder disease<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Functional disability of the shoulder was also assessed using the CS, which includes an
analysis of pain, shoulder motion, strength, and function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The degree of shoulder pain was graded using the Verbal Numeric
Scale (VNS). When using the VNS, the patients were asked to rate their pain on a scale from
0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain and 10 the worst pain possible<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The shoulder active ROM was measured with a goniometer
that demonstrated good reliability (ICC &#x02265;0.80)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the sitting position, shoulder flexion, abduction, and external
rotation were measured (in degrees) with the goniometer, and internal rotation was measured
as the distance (in cm) from the base of the occiput to the highest point the hand could
reach up behind the back (HBB) with a tape measure.</p><p>We performed the Wilcoxon rank test to compare differences before and after intervention in
each group. Comparisons of the mean values of SPADI, CS, VNS, and ROM across all groups were
performed using the Kruskal Wallis test. When statistical significance was found, multiple
comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS 18.0, and significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic characteristics of the participants (n = 53) were as follows. Their mean

treatment. In general, intra-articular steroid injections, capsular distension, and joint
mobilization therapy are known to be effective in the treatment of AC. While, joint
mobilization techniques improve the mobility of the joint and soft tissues<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, researchers have reported different
results with regards to pain management. Steroid injection therapy is very effective for
pain reduction, but results in a relatively small improvement in ROM. This study
demonstrated that additional intensive mobilization techniques after distension with steroid
injection are the most effective intervention for AC.</p><p>Capsular distension is a method of separating the adherent synovium using hydrostatic
pressure by injecting a large amount of fluid. Rizk et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> explained that capsular distension shares a mechanism similar to
manipulation under anesthesia. Intra-articular steroid injection in AC also shows efficacy
by reducing the inflammatory response to the pathological process. Steroid injection is
frequently used together with capsular distension, in order to reduce the symptoms and to
increase the treatment effect during the inflammation phase. In this study, the IMSID and
SID groups received capsular distension and steroid injection. They both showed improvements
in all the measured values, and the IMSID group had a higher variation than the SID group.
In a systematic review, Buchbinder et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the same results, suggesting that short term benefits with
regard to pain, range of movement, and function can be achieved with capsular distension
using saline and steroids.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of joint mobilization for patients with
AC<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The accumulated evidence indicates that not only passive joint
mobilization, but also active mobilization, such as Kaltenborn&#x02019;s convex-concave rule and MWM
may need to be considered to improve pain, ROM, and shoulder function. In this study, the
IMSID and IM groups received intensive mobilization and showed improvement in all outcome
measures.</p><p>Khan et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported greater improvement
in pain and ROM in patients receiving distension with steroid injection and physical
therapy, such as therapeutic exercises, than participants receiving physical therapy alone;
however, they reported no difference in the VAS pain score. According to our present
results, there were significant differences in pain, AROM, and shoulder function scores
between the IMSID and SID groups, as well as between the IMSID and GPT groups. Although
there were significant differences between the IM and SID groups, and between the IM and GPT
groups, the improvements were greater in the IMSID group than in the IM group. These results
support our hypothesis that intensive mobilization techniques combined with capsular
distension and steroid injection would improve pain, AROM, and the shoulder function of
patients with AC, more than among those receiving only one kind of therapeutic approach.</p><p>In this study, only capsular distension treatment, including steroid injection without
intensive mobilization, or simple conservative treatment, such as thermoelectric therapy,
was effective. However, there is not yet enough evidence to suggest that this method is
optimal for the treatment of frozen shoulder.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the most effective treatment for subacute AC is a
combination of intensive mobilization and steroid injection with capsular distension, and
helped to control inflammation, extend joint space, and recover ROM. Therefore, intensive
mobilization should be conducted by a skilled physical therapist after steroid injection
with capsular distension to optimize the treatment effect for patients with AC.</p><p>In this study, the intervention period was only 4 weeks. It will be necessary to
investigate the long-term treatment effects because of the unique aspects of AC. Further
studies according to the stage of AC should also be undertaken.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rizk</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinals</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Frozen shoulder</article-title>. <source>Semin Arthritis
