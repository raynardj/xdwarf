However, the temporal variability of their mud and methane emissions is unknown. Methane emissions were previously proposed to result from a dynamic equilibrium between upward migration and consumption at the seabed by methane-consuming microbes. Here we show non-steady-state situations of vigorous mud movement that are revealed through variations in fluid flow, seabed temperature and seafloor bathymetry. Time series data for pressure, temperature, pH and seafloor photography were collected over 431 days using a benthic observatory at the active H&#x000e5;kon Mosby Mud Volcano. We documented 25 pulses of hot subsurface fluids, accompanied by eruptions that changed the landscape of the mud volcano. Four major events triggered rapid sediment uplift of more than a metre in height, substantial lateral flow of muds at average velocities of 0.4&#x02009;m per day, and significant emissions of methane and CO<sub>2</sub> from the seafloor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Here, the authors provide the first long-term monitoring from H&#x000e5;kon Mosby and suggest that mud volcanoes may be more important to the global methane budget than previously thought.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Submarine mud volcanoes are geologic structures deeply rooted into the subsurface seafloor, formed by mud expulsions and associated transport of warm, deep-sourced fluids and gas, predominantly methane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. At high pressures and low temperatures, methane oversaturation can result in gas hydrate formation in sediment pore spaces, which may seal the seafloor against upwardly migrating fluids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Gas hydrates, hence, may act as a buffer, providing a persistent source of dissolved methane to near-surface sediments and fuelling rich and diverse ecosystems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Anaerobic and aerobic microbial oxidation consume the majority of the methane advected to near-surface sediments, where sulphate and oxygen are available as electron acceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, this microbial filter is less efficient when the ascent rates of subsurface fluids are high, as the flux of electron acceptors (for example, sulphate) into the sediments decreases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. At very high fluid-flow velocities, bubble-forming gaseous methane can bypass the microbial filter within the sediments completely and escape into the overlying water column<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Dissolved methane discharge from the seafloor can also occur when rapid seepage hinders the penetration of seawater-derived electron acceptors into the sediment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> or when methane-oxidizing microorganisms are absent from freshly erupted mud<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Consequently, when seepage is vigorous and/or when mud is remobilized, the proportion of the total methane flux being oxidized by the microbial filter may be &#x0003c;40% (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), depending on upflow rates and frequencies of disturbance. The total methane emission from offshore mud volcanoes into the atmosphere has been estimated at 27&#x02009;Tg per year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, but this value has large associated uncertainties, because the total number of mud volcanoes worldwide and their temporal variability with respect to methane emissions are both unknown. Various historical records suggest that eruptions of onshore mud volcanoes occur with intervals of years to decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Marine mud volcanism can also be episodic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, but the characteristics and frequency of eruptions of deep-sea mud volcanoes are not yet documented. To investigate the temporal variability of deep-sea mud-volcanic activity, we deployed a seafloor observatory for a period of 431 days in 2009&#x02013;2010 at the active H&#x000e5;kon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV), located at 1,250&#x02009;m water depth on the Barents Sea slope<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>The HMMV is a circular feature of around 1&#x02009;km in diameter with a shallow relief of &#x0003c;10&#x02009;m above the surrounding seafloor. Extremely high geothermal gradients of &#x0003e;25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the upper metre of the seafloor of the northern part of the mud volcano&#x02019;s centre indicate high upward fluid flow rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> of &#x0003e;4&#x02009;m per year above the deeply rooted mud volcano chimney<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. There, a central, flat area of soft, rippled muds is surrounded by more consolidated muds covered by bacterial mats, and a hummocky ring of hydrate-bearing mounds covered by siboglinid tubeworms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The concentric structure of these habitats has been attributed to a gradient in seepage rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, from the central upflow pipe to the outer rim, of 5&#x02013;&#x0003c;0.1&#x02009;m per year. Across the mud volcano and particularly in the hummocky periphery, gas hydrates are abundant, and gas ebullition from the seabed has been observed frequently, resulting in large gas flares that can be detected readily in the overlying water column<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>In a large interdisciplinary effort we designed, built and deployed a device for long-term observations on mud-volcano eruptions (LOOME). The objective of the LOOME observatory was to derive a timeline of temperature gradients and mud transport, combined with seafloor observations that would allow us to test the hypotheses that temperature dynamics, morphological and bathymetrical changes could be related to eruptions of gas and mud<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Comparisons of maps made during this project and previous research cruises showed drastic topological changes developing over years. Our LOOME observatory recorded even more substantial sediment and fluid dynamics, occurring over days to weeks. Our data provided a basis for a mechanistic understanding of the geological and geochemical activity of this large mud volcano. We conclude that the amount of escaping methane is much larger than previously thought.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Deployment and site</title><p>The LOOME observatory frame with data loggers was deployed in July 2009 within the peripheral hummocky area. Using a remotely operated vehicle, the observatory was positioned precisely on top of a stable slab, to avoid data loss in the event of any destructive eruptions that might damage the attached instrumentation deployed across the interior of the HMMV &#x02018;caldera&#x02019;. The location of the frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) was ~50&#x02009;m north of the active centre, of the HMMV that is characterized by high temperature gradients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <italic>QUEST</italic> deployed three cables from the LOOME observatory frame that extended out into the active centre, each with distinct scientific instrumentation connected back to the central data loggers on the LOOME frame: (1) an 80-cm-long sediment temperature lance; (2) a pH sensor and (3) a temperature sensor chain with 24 sensors distributed over 100&#x02009;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). A CTD system (recording conductivity, temperature and density; Seabird, SBE 911plus) equipped with an additional pressure sensor, as well as a recording current meter with a turbidity sensor were mounted on the LOOME frame. Two further independent instrument deployments were implemented as part of our LOOME observatory efforts: (4) the AIM autonomous underwater video camera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> was installed at the transition facing towards the active centre in an area of the seafloor covered by abundant microbial mats; (5) a 12-m-long sediment temperature lance was deployed at the southern transition between the active centre and the surrounding muds. Surveys by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), provided continuous spatial observations complementing shipboard observations in 2010.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vertical movements</title><p>Bottom-water pressure data recorded at the observatory frame, converted into a time series of water depth at the seafloor, indicated four major events during 2009 and 2010, as defined here by a sudden uplift of the seabed at rates between 0.2 and 0.7&#x02009;m&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The most pronounced uplift event, P1 (<italic>ca.</italic> 0.6&#x02009;m over 3.5&#x02009;h), started at 12:40&#x02009;UTC on 27 September 2009. A comparison of images recorded by the underwater video camera pointing towards the central mud area at 08:58&#x02009;UTC and at 20:58&#x02009;UTC (27 September 2009) clearly shows that the seafloor ruptured, indicative of deformation associated with the uplift event P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). During the following 9 months, three further but smaller uplift events were recorded. The images did not show resuspension of sediments in the form of particle clouds. Likewise, the turbidity sensor did not record immediate disturbances at the time of uplift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Cumulatively, the four major events resulted in a total uplift of 1.3&#x02009;m, but the seafloor also deflated gradually in between each of those events such that, by August 2010, the seafloor had gained only 0.2&#x02009;m in increased height compared with the September 2009 start of our time series.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Horizontal movements</title><p>These events, all recorded at the relatively stable hummocky area to the north of the active centre, were accompanied by drastic evidence of seafloor dynamics in the centre of the HMMV. A short temperature lance had been inserted vertically into the sediment at a location 60&#x02009;m south of the frame, where we expected the highest level of volcanic activity. When we inspected the instrument on 27 September 2010 prior to its recovery, the lance had been pulled out of the sediment and was lying horizontally on the seafloor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). On 26 October 2009, two days after the sudden uplifting event P2, the temperature signals for all of the sensors along the length of that lance had decreased to bottom-water temperature levels over a period of &#x0003c;3&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We interpret these results to indicate the time and date for the onset of lateral sediment displacement at the centre of the HMMV which, because the lance was tethered to the fixed LOOME observatory frame, had been pulled out of the laterally displaced mud until it came to rest on the HMMV surface. Further support for this inference comes from our separate visual observation that the similarly cable-tethered buckets housing the pH logger and temperature sensors attached to the LOOME observatory frame had left similar parallel trails in the surface of the sediment, as if they had been pulled across the seafloor. The cables connecting the various sensors to the logger on the LOOME observatory frame were all fully stretched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Perhaps most surprising of all, however, was the observation that our 12-m-long temperature lance had been relocated to ~165&#x02009;m south of its deployment position by the time it was recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This lance was deployed in 2009 at the southern transition of the active centre of the HMMV, where it had sunk deep into the soft muds to about 17&#x02009;m below the seafloor. Thus it was transported laterally with a mean velocity of ~0.4&#x02009;m per day over the course of the 431-day deployment. The displaced lance remained upright (vertical) relative to the seafloor and operated thoroughly throughout its transit, successfully recording substantial cooling of initially hot surface sediments above a warm (maximum temperature 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) layer of mud (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Episodic horizontal movements</title><p>The seabed thermistor chain that covered a 100-m-long N&#x02013;S transect from the LOOME observatory frame across the hot central area recorded multiple transient local temperature anomalies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The three sensors located outside the active central area near the observatory frame (T22&#x02013;T24) recorded background seafloor temperatures between &#x02212;0.886 and &#x02212;0.657&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, close to those of local bottom water, throughout the entire time series. In contrast, at the positions of the other sensors (T1&#x02013;T21), temperatures ranged between &#x02212;0.057 and 10.931&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Distributions of temperature anomalies observed along this temperature chain are consistent with a progressive migration away from the LOOME observatory frame, that is, southwards away from the active centre over the course of our time series records. Plots of these temporal dynamics in surface seabed temperature along the thermistor chain (distance of 100&#x02009;m) reveal a diagonal trend for these anomalies that we interpret as lateral transport of warm mud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Some of the pronounced anomalies were sustained along the whole length of the string, and indicate a displacement of 160&#x02013;200&#x02009;m over the observation period, providing close independent agreement with the ~165-m displacement observed for the 12-m T-lance (see previous section). Close inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> reveals that this ~165&#x02009;m of movement was not continuous and gradual but, rather, occurred as distinct episodes, separated by longer, static periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). In total, we have identified evidence for 25 flow events, grouped into 13 distinct episodes of sediment movement that each lasted for periods from 4&#x02009;h up to ~8 days (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Some of these episodes coincided with phases of elevated turbidity signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). The sum of the average displacements achieved over these 13 episodes, cumulatively, was 280&#x02013;350&#x02009;m (sum of the largest distances of each period from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), that is, even further than the observed displacement of the 12-m T-lance. Thus, the lateral sediment velocity during the entire observation averaged about 0.5&#x02013;1&#x02009;m per day across the active centre.</p><p>During several displacement events the pH at the surface decreased, indicating that mud movement was accompanied by release of warm CO<sub>2</sub>-rich subsurface fluids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Indeed, both methane and CO<sub>2</sub> flares were observed in the most active area by the AUV <italic>Sentry</italic> equipped with the <italic>in situ</italic> mass spectrometer TETHYS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the spatial distributions of gas flares resulting from ebullition of gas bubbles from the seafloor had changed between 2009 and 2010. Between 2009 and 2010 the position of these flares showed an overall shift in southeasterly directions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Seafloor photography of the active, warm centre showed conspicuous cracks and troughs as well as distinct mud flows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) while similar surveys of the southward region revealed that the seafloor was littered with small holes, consistent with the hollow depressions left behind after gas bubbles had been extruded through and released from these soft, warm sediments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>High-resolution bathymetric maps made in 2003 (Ifremer), 2006 (Ifremer) and 2010 (WHOI) indicate that the mud volcano centre, and especially its warm, elevated northern part, has been dynamic over the past decade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Comparison of extracted morphologies from north to south across the mud volcano reveals an irregular increase in height of 0&#x02013;0.6&#x02009;m with, in the most active area (50&#x02013;150&#x02009;m along profile), an increase of ~0.25&#x02009;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our 1-year deployment of independent sensors recorded episodes of massive lateral mud transport related to the upward flow of hot fluids. The very rapid uplift and slower deflation of the seafloor below the observatory can only be explained by rapid expansion of trapped gasses followed by their gradual release, causing the observed disturbances of seafloor morphology. This is further corroborated by the constant temperature in the area close to the observatory frame, confirming that the lifting and cracking of the surface seafloor in this area was caused by gas expansion. Further away, in the active central zone of the HMMV, which is characterized by mobile muds, seabed temperatures peaked markedly during sediment movement, indicating that considerable local seabed warming occurred due to mud-volcanic activity transporting warm fluids. The 24-h mean seabed temperature record over the entire observation period revealed elevated temperatures, in particular, during episodes of active sediment movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). These mud displacements occurred on a roughly monthly basis, but were not linked to the lunar phase as has been suggested previously for terrestrial mud volcanoes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>Our findings show for the first time the sequence of landscape-scale changes of a deep-sea mud volcano and, together with previous observations, support the hypothesis of recurring episodic degassing of the HMMV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Previous recordings in 2005&#x02013;2006 of the temperature near the active area showed sudden cooling events in the upper 15&#x02009;m, and short temperature sensors deployed by 2005 in the active central area had completely disappeared in 2006 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The microbathymetry maps of 2003, 2006 and 2010 show changes in morphology, especially in the active northern centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>), indicative of mud movements. Interestingly, comparison of those maps reveals no evidence of sediment overflow to the surrounding area, even in the flat south-eastern edge of the HMMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; see also maps in Foucher <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In summary, such mud movements must be episodically recurring events, yet there are no signs of massive accumulations of mud in the HMMV, and there is no evidence of mud flow to the outside of the volcano. Instead, volume is apparently conserved which, consequently, requires that the massive upward and lateral mud movements that we have recorded must be accompanied by an equal and opposite recycling of mud volume within the HMMV mud chamber<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, for example, through the sinking of degassed and cooled sediment layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>)&#x02014;which, therefore, would be relatively dense&#x02014;at the outer periphery of the HMMV.</p><p>Seismic signatures recorded in 2005 and 2006 suggest that transport and expansion of methane can cause a significantly lower density in the deep subsurface mud chamber fuelling the central chimney of the mud volcano when compared with the overlying and surrounding sediments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. A temporary increase in gas supply from the root of the HMMV could lead to unstable density gradients, and a rapid upward transport of warm, gassy muds. Such events could dissociate the gas hydrates that are usually present at the surface of the HMMV as it is cooled by the overlying cold bottom water. The slope of the HMMV surface has an overall gradient of 0.3&#x02009;m per 100&#x02009;m. While hydrates should stabilize the surface muds during quiescent periods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, any hydrate destabilization and expansion of gas by warming would be expected to lead to a substantial bulging of the seafloor, which could then, in turn, result in the lateral sliding of mud down-slope from north to south. Such a mechanism would explain both the southward movements of warm muds as recorded by the thermistor chain and the displacement of the thermal lance. The lance was positioned vertically into the sediment over a depth horizon of 8&#x02013;20&#x02009;m below the seafloor during the whole deployment period which, therefore, requires that a consolidated slab of mud of at least 20&#x02009;m in thickness was displaced southward, intact, over a distance of at least 165&#x02009;m. This, in turn, must have been resupplied by fresh, gassy mud expelled at the centre of the active zone. Comparing maps generated in 2006 with those acquired during the recovery cruise in 2010, we estimate the width of the mobile area to be ~200&#x02009;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), equivalent to a mobile volume of the order of 660,000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> of gassy mud (calculated as 20 &#x000d7; 165 &#x000d7; 200&#x02009;m). Extrapolating the overall uplift of the seafloor bathymetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) by an average of 0.3&#x02009;m between 2006 and 2010 to the entire centre area of the mud volcano (200,000&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>) results in a volume increase in 4 years of only 60,000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>, that is, &#x0003c;10% of the estimated volume that moved in 2009&#x02013;2010. We do not exclude the possibility that processes active in the volcano could also expel subsurface porewaters, which would reduce the estimated amount of gas required to elevate the sediments. Indeed, the pH anomalies recorded in the HMMV sediments argue for an enhanced expulsion of rather acidic porewater<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> during sediment movement. While porewater flow in the central area can reach upward flow velocities of several metres per year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, the uplift we have recorded here was much faster, up to 60&#x02009;cm in a few hours&#x02014;that is, three orders of magnitude faster than porewater movements could achieve. Consequently, we conclude that most of the uplift we report here must have been gas driven.</p><p>Over the entire period four very rapid uplift events were recorded, totalling 1.3&#x02009;m, accompanied by release of gas from the sediment and each followed by seafloor subsidence. It should be noted that the active central HMMV area may have experienced even more uplift than recorded at the location of the LOOME observatory frame situated on the hummocky terrain at the Northern edge of the HMMV. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> shows that areas 175&#x02013;350&#x02009;m south of the frame became more elevated than the hummocky area, where the frame was positioned and where the vertical dynamics were registered. With the assumption that these events were mostly gas driven, we can estimate a gas expansion of 1.3&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of seafloor. Most of this gas was likely supplied through upward fluid advection from the deep subsurface, but in part it may also have originated from destabilization of gas hydrates located within the upper sediment layers. Applying this unit volume of gas expansion and extrapolating it to cover the whole of the displaced/elevated mud area (165 &#x000d7; 200&#x02009;m), would imply a release of 43,000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> of methane at 120&#x02009;atm (the <italic>in situ</italic> pressure at the seafloor at the HMMV), which is equivalent to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;mol of methane gas. In earlier work it was estimated that 8&#x02013;35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;mol of methane escape from HMMV per year in the form of gas bubbles released from single streams<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, an estimate that does not include recurrent eruptions of the kind documented here. For example, if eruptions were to occur at a frequency of one eruptive event per year with the same magnitude that we describe here, the total annual methane release from the HMMV mud volcano would be an order of magnitude higher than all previous estimates. In comparison, the sum of the biological removal rates for methane released at HMMV, by aerobic and anaerobic oxidation, is only 5&#x02013;15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;mol per year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Thus, from our new calculations, we would predict that &#x0003c;3% of the total methane released from the HMMV might be oxidized at or beneath the seafloor. Thus the vast majority of the methane released escapes into the overlying water column and, potentially, the atmosphere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Of course, we cannot be completely certain of the total area of seafloor uplifted, whether the average elevation of 1.3&#x02009;m reported here is typical of such an event, and what the frequency of recurrence might be for the events observed here. Consequently, our calculations on the amounts of released gas must be considered as an indicative/illustrative first approximation. However, our core conclusions&#x02014;that much more methane gas is released from the HMMV than had previously been appreciated and that only a very small fraction of the total methane flux might be microbially mediated and mitigated in the upper sediments&#x02014;agree closely with the identical isotope compositions observed for methane both within HMMV hydrates and in dissolved methane sampled in the overlying watercolumn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Moreover, the sporadic extrusion of subsurface muds onto the mud volcano centre is likely to create major disturbances to the benthic communities present, as evidenced from the seabed photography surveys completed during our mission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Such perturbations to these ecosystems will inhibit the development of efficiently methane-consuming microbial communities in the area of highest methane fluxes. Because anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia only grow very slowly, re-establishing such a microbial filter on freshly expelled mud may require months to years&#x02014;that is, over timescales that may be comparable to or even longer than the intervals anticipated between successive eruption events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesize that recurrent eruption events at deep-water mud volcanoes such as HMMV may represent significant previously overlooked sources for dissolved methane release to the hydrosphere; these require further evaluation through continuous long-term observations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Observatory design</title><p>The LOOME observatory comprised sensors for the subsurface, the seabed and the water column. The frame was a platform measuring 2 &#x000d7; 2&#x02009;m, which carried two CTDs, a horizontal-looking sonar and a recording current meter with a turbidity sensor (Aanderaa, Norway). The current meter data showed that the LOOME frame was positioned upstream of the active centre (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

The LOOME observatory frame (F) was positioned north of the centre, where the hummocky seafloor provided a solid base for our long-term instrument deployment. The seabed thermistor chain (dashed line) with 24 sensor nodes was laid out across the northern part of the active centre. The short temperature lance and the chemistry logger (T) were placed at the position of the highest geothermal gradient. The camera (C) was placed on the edge of the central area in a field of abundant microbial mats. The long temperature lance was deployed south of the centre in July 2009 (D) but had moved 165&#x02009;m further to the south by the time it was recovered in September 2010 (R).
