Papillary muscle fibres were dissected from cMyBP-C mutated mice of ADA (Ala273-Asp282-Ala302), DAD (Asp273-Ala282-Asp302), SAS (Ser273-Ala282-Ser302), and t/t (cMyBP-C null) genotypes, and the results were compared to transgenic mice expressing wide-type (WT) cMyBP-C. Sinusoidal analyses were performed with serial concentrations of ATP, phosphate (Pi), and ADP. Both t/t and DAD mutants significantly reduced active tension, force per cross-bridge, apparent rate constant (2&#x003c0;<italic>c</italic>), and the rate constant of cross-bridge detachment. In contrast to the weakened ATP binding and enhanced Pi and ADP release steps in t/t mice, DAD mice showed a decreased ADP release without affecting the ATP binding and the Pi release. ADA showed decreased ADP release, and slightly increased ATP binding and cross-bridge detachment steps, whereas SAS diminished the ATP binding step and accelerated the ADP release step. t/t has the broadest effects with changes in most elementary steps of the cross-bridge cycle, DAD mimics t/t to a large extent, and ADA and SAS predominantly affect the nucleotide binding steps. We conclude that the reduced tension production in DAD and t/t is the result of reduced force per cross-bridge, instead of the less number of strongly attached cross-bridges. We further conclude that cMyBP-C is an allosteric activator of myosin to increase cross-bridge force, and its phosphorylation status modulates the force, which is regulated by variety of protein kinases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health HL070041 (MK), R01HL105826 and K02HL114749 (SS) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>), The American Heart Association - Scientist Development Grant (0830311N), Grant-in-Aid (14GRNT20490025) (SS) and Grant-in-Aid (13GRNT16810043) (MK) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/">http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/</ext-link>).

A recent study found that DAA and AAD mice exhibited left ventricular dilation, interstitial fibrosis, irregular cardiac rhythm, and sudden cardiac death, suggesting that the normal phosphorylation status of the three Ser residues is essential for cardiac function, and that chronic phosphorylation at one site, with the inability to phosphorylate the other sites, can be detrimental to the maintenance of normal cardiac structure and function <xref rid="pone.0113417-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>With the importance of cMyBP-C phosphorylation in contraction, regulation, and the hierarchically functional S273, S282 and S302 sites in mind, we have recently found that phospho-aberrant (nonphosphorylatable) Ala282 combined with phosphomimetic residues Asp273 and/or Asp302 (in DAD) is detrimental to cardiomyocytes as evidenced by the lower active isometric tension and altered cross-bridge kinetics with decreased 2&#x003c0;<italic>c</italic> (fast rate constant) and increased 2&#x003c0;<italic>b</italic> (medium rate constant). On the other hand, a single change of residue 282 to phospho-aberrant Ala (SAS), or to phosphomimetic Asp together with changes of residues 273 and 302 to nonphosphorylatable Ala (ADA), caused a minute change in fibre mechanics <xref rid="pone.0113417-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Based on these findings, we aimed at studying further the site-specific effect of cMyBP-C phosphorylation on cross-bridge force and elementary steps of the cross-bridge cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113417-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). For this purpose, different concentrations of ATP (0.05&#x02013;10 mM), Pi (0&#x02013;30 mM), and ADP (0&#x02013;3 mM) were applied to skinned cardiac papillary and trabecular muscle fibres. During Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, small amplitude sinusoidal length changes were applied to the fibres and the tension transients were recorded, through which the kinetic constants were deduced, and the elementary steps as well as force per cross-bridge were characterized. We found that the reduced tension production in DAD and t/t is the result of reduced force per cross-bridge, instead of the less number of strongly attached cross-bridges, emphasizing the significance of cMyBP-C in allosteric activation of cross-bridge force.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.

One hook was connected to a length driver to change the fibre length, and the other to a tension transducer to detect isometric tension and its transients. After mounting, fibres were soaked in relaxing solution for a few minutes and thereafter further skinning for 20 min in the relaxing solution to which 1% Triton X-100 was added. Before applying activating solutions for mechanical measurements, fibres were washed with the relaxing solution and their length was adjusted to remove the slack.

S282 phosphorylation has been shown to play a leading role in the phosphorylation of other sites <xref rid="pone.0113417-Gautel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113417-Sadayappan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In ADA, with phospho-mimetic S282 and phospho-ablated S273 and S302, the significantly increased association constant for ADP (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113417-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) causes a reduced ADP release resulting in a slower sarcomere shortening. This is because the shortening velocity is controlled by the rate at which ADP can escape from cross-bridges after completion of the power stroke <xref rid="pone.0113417-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There is a strong correlation between the maximum ATP hydrolysis rate (V<sub>max</sub>) and the rate of ADP release from actomyosin <xref rid="pone.0113417-Siemankowski1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These observations may account for the reduced systolic function found in ADA mice <xref rid="pone.0113417-Sadayappan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In SAS with phospho-ablated S282, the result is opposite to ADA, as shown by the decreased <italic>K</italic>

No apparent abnormalities: fibrosis, calcification, or disarray, were found in the ADA or SAS mouse phenotype <xref rid="pone.0113417-Sadayappan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, the results in muscle mechanics in the present study and the histological results <xref rid="pone.0113417-Sadayappan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> are consistent. ADA and SAS produced small effects in cross-bridge kinetics with the only effects in <italic>K</italic>

The fact that ADA and SAS affect the ATP binding and ADP release steps, and DAD affects multiple steps demonstrates that a different mutant affects different elementary steps in the cross-bridge cycle. We have further found that t/t and DAD are more harmful mutations to cause detrimental effects than ADA and SAS mutations.</p><p>The fact that only central 9/17 (53%, c-zone) of the thick filament accompanies cMyBP-C, and the remaining 8/17 (47%, b-zone for cMyBP-C &#x0201c;bare&#x0201d; zone) does not accompany cMyBP-C <xref rid="pone.0113417-Luther1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> needs a consideration.

This reduction may increase the probability of cross-bridge formation, and may accelerate the force generation step (see review by <xref rid="pone.0113417-Granzier1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>). Our study has demonstrated that phosphorylation of the two PKC sites (Ser273 and Ser302) strengthens the interaction between cMyBP-C and myosin S2, but diminishes its interaction with actin <xref rid="pone.0113417-Govindan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, the differential effects of each phosphorylation site on binding to S2 are not completely understood. These molecular interactions between cMyBP-C, myosin S2, and actin must be the bases for cMyBP-C induced active force enhancement as we observed in WT <italic>vs.</italic> t/t. One likely explanation is an allosteric activation of myosin so that it interacts with actin in a more efficient way. This interaction can be modulated by phosphorylation of cMyBP-C by a variety of protein kinases. Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of cMyBP-C is to increase the active force, and cMyBP-C's phosphorylation is to modulate the amount of active force generation depending on which protein kinase is activated in cardiomyocytes at a particular moment.</p><p>The phosphorylation status of cMyBP-C or its mutants may interfere with phosphorylation of other myofilament proteins. Our results indicate that the decreased or absence of cMyBP-C phosphorylation is accompanied with a decreased RLC phosphorylation (in t/t, ADA and DAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113417-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting that the phosphorylation of the two proteins is inter-related. The proposed physical interaction between the M-domain of cMyBP-C and RLC <xref rid="pone.0113417-Pfuhl1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> may contribute to the RLC phosphorylation triggered by cMyBP-C phosphorylation. The close correlation between cMyBP-C and RLC was also demonstrated in solution that cMyBP-C induced a significant increase in the actin-activated ATPase activity of both native and RLC-reconstituted myosin, but had no effect on RLC-deficient myosin <xref rid="pone.0113417-Margossian1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The decreased RLC phosphorylation has no relation with the decreased tension per cross-bridge, because the latter only occurs in t/t and DAD, but not in ADA. However, we found that the rigor stiffness decreased in the t/t, ADA and DAD mice, all exhibited decreased RLC phosphorylation. Considering the influence of RLC phosphorylation on lever-arm stiffness <xref rid="pone.0113417-Greenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, we conclude that the decreased RLC phosphorylation causes increased rigor stiffness, and this may be related to the altered distance of the myosin head to the thick filament <xref rid="pone.0113417-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A slightly decreased level of cMyBP-C phosphorylation was found in ADA <xref rid="pone.0113417-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which is similar to our finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113417-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>A novel phosphorylation site Ser133 within the proline-alanine-rich linker domain between domains C0 and C1 was newly identified in human cMyBP-C <xref rid="pone.0113417-Kuster1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This site could be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#x003b2;), but not by protein kinase A (PKA). GSK3&#x003b2; has a modulating effect on sarcomere function by increasing the rate of tension redevelopment <xref rid="pone.0113417-Kuster1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. There is a possibility that additional phosphorylation sites in cMyBP-C may continue to be found, and its phosphorylation status may be associated with the phosphorylation of other sites.</p><p>The significantly decreased phosphorylation in cTnI, cTnT, RLC, and desmin, but not in cMyBP-C, was discovered in a study with frame shift mutation of cMyBP-C that was carried by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients <xref rid="pone.0113417-vanDijk1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In our mouse models, cMyBP-C protein was totally missing in the t/t mice and the mutated cMyBP-C was present at the similar levels in ADA, DAD, SAS, and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113417-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). This difference may cause a distinct effect on other myofilament proteins. An expression of skeletal TnT was found in the homozygous cardiac cMyBP-C-null (t/t) mice <xref rid="pone.0113417-Cazorla1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Specific antibody or mRNA probes are needed to identify these protein isoforms.</p><p>Several studies found that an increase in &#x003b2;-MHC expression in t/t mouse hearts <xref rid="pone.0113417-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113417-Sadayappan3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113417-Desjardins1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, which may affect observed rate constants <xref rid="pone.0113417-Wang5" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Consequently, our observations may be confounded by a mutation and an isoform shift. For this reason, we studied the MHC isoform content in our previous work <xref rid="pone.0113417-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We found that our conclusions on ADA, DAD, and SAS were not significantly affected, because the isoform shift in them were small. In t/t, there was a significant increase in &#x003b2;-MHC expression. However, the involvement of isoform shift may not modify our conclusions on tension, stiffness, or magnitude parameters, because tension is not sensitive to the MHC isoform shifting <xref rid="pone.0113417-Wang5" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113417-Rundell1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and stiffness and magnitude parameters are generally scaled with tension. The decreased force/cross-bridge (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>56</sub>) in t/t is consistent with the observation that a partial (29&#x000b1;3%) extraction of cMyBP-C resulted in &#x0223c;30% reduction in maximal force <xref rid="pone.0113417-Kulikovskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>The absence of cMyBP-C appear to cause a problem in cardiomyocyte organization, as demonstrated by disorganized and damaged sarcomere structures in t/t mice <xref rid="pone.0113417-Sadayappan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which may cause further confounding problems. Consequently, the ultrastructural changes may partly account for the decreased force/cross-bridge in this report. These problems are difficult to solve in fiber studies on transgenic mouse hearts, and additional methods with future experimentations are expected to sort them out.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Summary and Conclusions</title><p>DAD, similar to t/t, significantly reduces force per cross-bridge, apparent rate constant (2&#x003c0;<italic>c</italic>), and decelerates the cross-bridge detachment step. DAD mutant further demonstrates a reduced ADP release, and the elevated rate constant of the force generation step. These are different from t/t, which exhibited weakened ATP binding and enhanced Pi and ADP release. ADA and SAS mutants demonstrate insignificant impact on the force per cross-bridge, apparent rate constants, and the kinetics involved in steps 4&#x02013;5. ADA slightly increases ATP binding and the cross-bridge detachment steps, and reduces ADP release, whereas SAS reduces ATP binding and promotes ADP release. Based on these findings, we conclude that the changes in the phosphorylation status of each site differentially affect the elementary steps of the cross-bridge cycle. In contrast to the limited influence on the ATP binding and the ADP release steps by ADA and SAS mutants, DAD produces broad effects by interfering with cross-bridge kinetics and negatively regulating force generation step, which largely mimic the t/t phenotype. Based on these findings, we conclude that it is the reduced force per cross-bridge, instead of the less numbers of strongly attached cross-bridges, that results in the reduced tension production in DAD and t/t mouse models. cMyBP-C, as an allosteric effector of myosin, increases the active force that cross-bridges generate, and its phosphorylation, which is regulated by variety of protein kinases, modulates the active force.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113417-Kawai1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
