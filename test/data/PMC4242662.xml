However, an overview of applied studies suggests that the uncertainty associated with these factors is not always appropriately incorporated or even considered. We examine the effects of choice of variables, climate models and emissions scenarios can have on future species distribution models using two endangered species: one a short-lived invertebrate species (Ptunarra Brown Butterfly), and the other a long-lived paleo-endemic tree species (King Billy Pine). We show the range in projected distributions that result from different variable selection, climate models and emissions scenarios. The extent to which results are affected by these choices depends on the characteristics of the species modelled, but they all have the potential to substantially alter conclusions about the impacts of climate change. We discuss implications for conservation planning and management, and provide recommendations to conservation practitioners on variable selection and accommodating uncertainty when using future climate projections in species distribution models.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research is an output from the Landscapes and Policy Research Hub.

Ensemble approaches produce multiple distribution maps that require summarising before interpretation is possible. Several methods have been suggested to achieve this and deal with the errors and uncertainties of different statistical models <xref rid="pone.0113749-Arajo3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These include representing the central tendency with median or mean values; highlighting spatial extents within which either one or all models show suitable habitat; presenting the degree of model agreement with frequency histograms; or probabilistic forecasting when large numbers of models are used <xref rid="pone.0113749-Arajo3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, while ensemble-based statistical methods may be appropriate to deal with errors and uncertainties between models, they may not always be the best way to summarise projected habitat ranges in SDMs due to the influence of differences in variable selection, climate model range and emissions scenarios.</p><p>Global climate models (GCMs) and emissions scenarios represent a range of plausible futures <xref rid="pone.0113749-Rosentrater1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. They are not intended to provide accurate predictions regarding the future state of the climate system at any given point in time, but to establish the envelope that future climate could conceivably occupy. For this reason, important information may be lost if an ensemble of GCMs are summarised inappropriately. For example, presenting a multi-model mean provides a &#x02018;central estimate&#x02019; of the projections obtained under a particular selection of GCMs and does not consider the variability represented by different climate models and/or emissions scenarios.</p><p>In this paper, we assess the literature in relation to SDM projections in applied ecological studies and evaluate the extent to which uncertainties attributable to selection of climatic variables and GCMs are addressed. Some uncertainty is not taken into account with SDMs, the classic example is the physiological response of plants and animals to an atmosphere with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In this paper the uncertainty from changing concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere cannot be addressed and thus these results assume a constant atmospheric concentration for a given emissions scenario. Informed by the findings of our literature review, we explore the influence of the choice of climatic variables and approaches to assimilating multiple SDMs based on a range of climate models and emissions scenarios using two threatened species from Tasmania, Australia, as case studies. We conclude with recommendations on the use of SDMs for conservation planners and managers.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Common approaches to SDM in applied ecology</title><p>To gain an overview of how SDMs are being used in applied studies of species distributions under climate change, we searched for articles in the ISI Web of Science database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webofknowledge.com">http://www.webofknowledge.com</ext-link>) from 1982 to 2013, where the phrases &#x02018;bioclimatic&#x02019; and &#x02018;climate change&#x02019; occurred in the title, abstract or author's keywords. In SDM literature, it has become common practice in ecological studies to refer to climatic variables derived from spatial interpolation of long-term mean monthly data as &#x02018;bioclimatic&#x02019; variables <xref rid="pone.0113749-Booth1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The aim of this overview was to provide a substantive sample of relevant literature rather than being a systematic review of all the literature and available databases. The search yielded 562 records, which we refined by selecting articles that contained the words &#x02018;niche&#x02019; or &#x02018;habitat&#x02019;, resulting in a total of 221 publications (the list of reviewed articles can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mendeley.com/groups/3315561/bioclim-review/papers/">http://www.mendeley.com/groups/3315561/bioclim-review/papers/</ext-link>). Since we focused on applied studies, review articles were omitted. A total of 163 articles had constructed SDMs for current or future terrestrial species distributions. From each article, we analysed information relating to predictor variables used in the SDM, the taxa, the scale and location of the study region, and how future climate projections were used. Data from the review were analysed using R <xref rid="pone.0113749-R1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Most of the reviewed articles focused on Europe (&#x0223c;30%), North America (&#x0223c;17%), Africa (&#x0223c;12%), South America (&#x0223c;11%), Australia and Oceania (&#x0223c;10%), with a small fraction on Asia (&#x0223c;3%). Note that the sum of fractions is &#x0003c;100% because some articles were methodological and did not include case studies. The majority of studies (58%) were carried out at the regional scale (e.g. geographic extent &#x02265;10000 km<sup>2</sup> &#x0003c;continental), 14% were at the continental scale, and just over 10% of the articles reported studies at scales of either &#x0003c;10 km<sup>2</sup> or between 1000 km<sup>2</sup> to 10000 km<sup>2</sup>. A small proportion of articles (&#x0223c;2%) carried out SDMs at the global scale. SDMs were used to study the potential impacts of climate change on the distributions of a wide range of taxa, including birds (&#x0223c;43%), reptiles and amphibians (&#x0223c;32%), plants (&#x0223c;19%), invertebrates (&#x0223c;12%) and mammals (&#x0223c;10%) with some articles modelling more than one taxon.</p><p>From the reviewed literature, we identified three common approaches to variable selection. The first common approach uses all available bioclimatic variables without justification. The BIOCLIM software, a sub-package of ANUCLIM <xref rid="pone.0113749-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> provides 35 variables, while WORLDCLIM <xref rid="pone.0113749-Hijmans1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> provides a subset of 19 bioclimatic variables. The second common approach reduces the number of bioclimatic and biophysical covariates to account for colinearity. The third selects variables based on ecological knowledge. Typically, the third involved assuming a causal relationship between a climatic variable and a theoretical or empirically established understanding of a species' eco-physiology, life history traits, patterns of movement, reproductive cycle or habitat requirements. Often the assumed causal relationship was general, such as the relationship between growing degrees days and biological growth rates <xref rid="pone.0113749-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A total of 119 distinct variables were used in the reviewed articles (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113749.s001">Figure S1</xref>) the most common being mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature used by 43% and 37% of the articles, respectively.</p><p>Diagnostic statistics regarding performance of SDMs were reported by 55% of the articles. The most commonly used statistics to assess the performance of SDMs were the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Kappa and R<sup>2</sup>. We found three approaches were commonly used to summarise the outputs of SDMs: (1) model mean tendency; (2) model agreement; and (3) the bounding box <xref rid="pone.0113749-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>About 10% of the reviewed papers provided justification for the selection of GCM. About 40% of the reviewed articles used two or more GCMs with one or two emissions scenarios. Only seven articles <xref rid="pone.0113749-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Bradley2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Bradley3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Bradley4" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Bradley5" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Lawler1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> used more than 10 GCMs and acknowledged variability in these inputs. Each of these seven articles focused on testing SDM methods, rather than applying SDMs to practical conservation problems.

King Billy Pine is a long-lived paleo-endemic tree that grows at altitudes of 600 m to 1100 m. In contrast, the Ptunarra Brown Butterfly is a short-lived species, which is active for three to four weeks in late February to April, at altitudes from 200 m to 1200 m. These species are endemic to Tasmania, Australia, and have been listed as endangered under the <italic>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</italic> 1999. We conducted SDM experiments to examine the range in projected distribution due to (a) the three common approaches to variable selection identified in the review and (b) the three different ways of accounting for the range in SDM results from using multiple GCMs and emissions scenarios.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Species Distribution Models</title><p>Presence data for the species were downloaded from the online database Atlas of Living Australia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://collections.ala.org.au/public">http://collections.ala.org.au/public</ext-link>) and databases of the state conservation agency, the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.naturalvaluesatlas.tas.gov.au/">https://www.naturalvaluesatlas.tas.gov.au/</ext-link>). There were 212 unique observations for the Ptunarra Brown Butterfly from 1949 to 2007; and 672 observations for The King Billy Pine from the period 1847 to 2005.</p><p>The MaxEnt model <xref rid="pone.0113749-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> was used to model the suitability of future climate for each species. While there are several other methods for modelling species distributions (e.g. generalised linear models, boosted regression trees, mechanistic models and ensemble techniques), we used MaxEnt because it is not computationally expensive, is widely used in applied ecological studies by government agencies and research organisations, and has been shown to perform well in comparison to several other models when there are relatively few presence records available <xref rid="pone.0113749-Elith2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We did not use an ensemble approach because, as noted, that issue has been extensively investigated and our focus here is on tools that are usable by conservation planners and managers who generally do not have access to the high computing capacity needed for ensemble modelling. We used R <xref rid="pone.0113749-R1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> to run MaxEnt, with fifteen replicate runs calculated by cross-validation using 30% of the data and default values for all other parameters (iterations&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;500, convergence threshold&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.00001, and regularization value&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1). Results are presented as the relative probability of occurrence, with suitable climate identified where this value is greater than 0.5 <xref rid="pone.0113749-Phillips2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>Three MaxEnt models, that represent the three common approaches to variable selection, were run for the two species using different sets of bioclimatic predictor variables. The first model used all available variables (see Table A1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113749.s006">File S1</xref>). The second model used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify a subset of available bioclimatic variables that are not strongly correlated (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0003c;0.6). The third model used expert knowledge of the target species to identify subsets of bioclimatic variables. The available bioclimatic variables represent annual trends (e.g. mean annual temperature and precipitation), seasonal trends (e.g. annual range in temperature or precipitation), and extreme or limiting environmental factors (e.g. temperature of the coldest and warmest month, precipitation for wettest or driest quarters). Model 1 used the most commonly used set of variables, based on the literature review, comprising 35 variables provided by BIOCLIM. These BIOCLIM variables defined the baseline climate.</p><p>Model 2 used a subset of uncorrelated bioclimatic variables selected using PCA that explained more than 90% of the variance. For the Ptunarra Brown Butterfly, the variables were: temperature seasonality (coefficient of variation, hereafter cv); maximum temperature warmest period; and mean temperature driest quarter and annual precipitation. For the King Billy Pine, the variables were: annual mean temperature: temperature seasonality (cv); temperature annual range; annual precipitation; annual mean radiation; radiation seasonality (cv); annual mean moisture index; and highest period moisture index.</p><p>Model 3 used variables chosen by experts based on knowledge of the species' life cycle. For the Ptunarra Brown Butterfly the selected bioclimatic variables were: March minimum temperature; April minimum temperature; annual minimum temperature; radiation with rainfall for April; and annual rainfall (Dr Peter McQuillan and Dr Phil Bell <italic>pers. comm.</italic>). For the King Billy Pine the selected bioclimatic variables were: maximum temperature warmest period; minimum temperature of coldest period; mean temperature warmest quarter; mean temperature coldest quarter; annual precipitation; precipitation driest period; annual mean moisture index; lowest period moisture index; and mean moisture index lowest quarter (Dr Jennie Whinam and Ms Louise Gilfedder <italic>pers. comm.</italic>).</p><p>We only used bioclimatic variables rather than other physical environmental or vegetation habitat variables in the model in order to provide an indication of changing climatic suitability assuming all else remains equal.

Using two species as case studies, we have shown that these uncertainties can affect the results of SDMs.</p><p>Ignoring the uncertainty associated with modelling future distributions may lead to over-confidence in single maps of future distributions, with consequences for conservation planning. The literature review revealed that both choice of variables and representation of future climate, by using a range of GCMs, are frequently opportunistic for SDMs in applied ecological studies. Using all available bioclimatic variables, instead of a tailored selection, increases the possibility of over-fitting species distribution models, and may lead to an over-estimate of range reduction and the likelihood of a forecasted extinction under climate change <xref rid="pone.0113749-Beaumont1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The importance of variable selection in determining the output of SDM depends on the characteristics of the species modelled. For example, variable selection may be less important for long-lived sedentary plant species such as the King Billy Pine but can be very important for mobile species with specific biological characteristics or requirements, such as the Ptunarra Brown Butterfly. For the butterfly, inclusion of different variables in the model led to widely divergent projected futures for end-of-century, ranging from close to no locations with a suitable climate <xref rid="pone.0113749-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> to maintenance of the current range.</p><p>Biological knowledge of the species can help in choosing variables amenable to ecological interpretation. Ideally, modellers, species experts and conservation practitioners should work as a team to build the SDM, interpret results and consider conservation management responses. However, such interdisciplinary exercises are uncommon and often little is known of the species' biology and ecology as they relate to climatic factors. In these cases, a range of statistical diagnostics can provide some guidance as to relative model performance, but there is no objective method for identifying the &#x02018;best&#x02019; SDM when projecting into the future. Statistical methods of model selection alone are not sufficient to accept or reject a model, as different performance indices (e.g. AUC, AIC, BIC) can give conflicting rankings <xref rid="pone.0113749-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Furthermore, statistical models are a measure of internal model performance, not a measure of ecological validity.</p><p>The accuracy with which the current distribution is represented by a SDM is an important consideration. However, an accurate fit with current distributions does not guarantee that the prediction of future potential distribution will be accurate. The underlying statistical relationship between the climatic variables and the distribution of the species may change due to, for example, nonlinear functional responses of the species or indirect impacts such as an altered fire regime. Considering the extent to which a SDM is attempting to project into novel climatic conditions is also an important consideration in model evaluation. Predicted potential distribution maps with large areas in which one or more climate variables were outside the range present in the data used to train the SDM should be treated with caution.</p><p>In contrast to variable selection, the range in outputs from climate models and emissions scenarios are not species dependent and will always need to be documented when modelling future distributions. We caution against using an ensemble mean of projected climate variables as input into an SDM, for several reasons. First, each global climate model represents one plausible future among many. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) now includes more than 50 climate models. Although there are several quantitative model &#x02018;skill scores&#x02019; that can be calculated for particular variables and features of the models, different models tend to perform well on some metrics and poorly on others. As a result, the IPCC avoids ranking models, and treats each equally (IPCC 2007, 2013). While multi-model GCM ensembles at large spatial scales have been shown to agree better with observations of present-day climate than single models for a range of variables <xref rid="pone.0113749-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Reichler1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, this is not always the case at smaller scales, including the continental scale <xref rid="pone.0113749-Fordham1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Considering multiple GCMs is therefore essential to capture the range of plausible projections. Further, the ensemble mean may not coincide with any of the climate model's projections but create a novel future climate that is merely a statistical derivative. And finally, using a multi-model GCM ensemble may not be the best approach for risk assessment in conservation planning, where considering the &#x02018;best&#x02019; and &#x02018;worst&#x02019; case scenarios may be a more useful framework in which to make decisions <xref rid="pone.0113749-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Harris2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>Multiple SDMs need to be run using a range of climate models and emissions scenarios as input. This approach produces a range of species distribution maps (12 for each species in our case study) which need to be assessed and combined in a useful way to help inform decision-making. The method used to combine the maps (e.g. taking the mean, the median, the bounding box or the minimum overlap of the different models) will influence interpretation of the results. This can have consequences where conservation effort is deployed across the landscape since both extent and location of projected suitable climate will differ between GCMs. Over-confidence in a single map risks the possibility that conservation investments are applied to areas that do not support the target species under future climate. Ongoing monitoring is essential to track changes as the species responds to changing climatic conditions. Using a map of an ensemble mean produces a future that was not projected by any single model. Adding all areas projected to be suitable (the bounding box) will be the most optimistic outlook, while only concentrating on areas where all models agree will provide the smallest estimate of future suitability.</p><p>The managers we consulted found that the most informative summary was the map showing the agreement between the models (pixels where all models agree a potential suitability above a threshold of 0.5) in addition to the current distribution as projected by the SDM that used baseline climate data. This was considered a low-risk option to highlight priority areas for biodiversity conservation in areas that currently support a target species or community.</p><p>One aspect of uncertainty in modelling future species distribution not illustrated here is that associated with the choice of SDM. Different statistical models have been shown to have a large influence on the results of SDMs and an ensemble approach is increasingly being used to account for the range in statistical models <xref rid="pone.0113749-DinizFilho1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113749-Arajo3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, the main purpose of this paper was to illustrate the effect that choice of variable, climate model and emissions scenario can have on the results of SDMs for future climatic conditions. We propose a protocol for conservation planners and managers that summarises our recommendations for using SDM under future climate projections in applied ecological studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113749-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0113749-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113749.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Decision tree to guide the application of SDMs under future climate to conservation management.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0113749.g004"/></fig><p>Our study highlighted that the relative change in the projected suitable climate envelope for the species is an important factor to consider. Our SDMs, based on climate variables, show that projections for the King Billy Pine are more consistent, and more consistently under threat, when viewed as relative change. A general hypothesis based on our results is that species with strong temperature dependencies are more strongly influenced by choice of emissions scenarios. If the future climate projections of the GCMs diverge, so will the SDMs, while if the climatic factor were not influential in the baseline model, the effect may be inconsequential. However, there is a threshold below which relative change is not important because, for example, the projected areas may not be of sufficient extent to support the species in any case. It is also important to note that our models, and SDM models generally, do not account for any of the other major threat to species such as habitat loss. All of these points emphasise that correct interpretation of a SDM outcome requires rigorous understanding of the inputs used in its development.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Species distribution models are useful tools for, among other things, informing the conservation management of wildlife and their habitats under a rapidly changing climate. They can provide decision makers with information about the likely degree of change in a species climatic domain and geographic distribution. However, the uncertainty associated with their estimation needs to be documented and understood if their output is to be effectively applied. Systematic conservation planning can draw on this information, together with ongoing field monitoring of target species to track changes as they occur, providing the foundation for adaptive management in response to emerging circumstances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113749.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The proportion of variables used in the revised literature.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0113749.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113749.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Distribution maps of significant difference (SD) between the current prediction of suitable habitat for Ptunarra Brown (PB) based on baseline climate, and the future projections, based on 30 Model 2 (M2, PCA selection of bioclimatic variables).
