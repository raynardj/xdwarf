It is mainly divided into three categories as Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, Wnt/planar cell polarity, and Wnt/calcium pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In particular, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, which also termed as &#x0201c;canonical pathway&#x0201d;, has been investigated extensively and well understood, comparing to other pathways termed as &#x0201c;noncanonical pathway&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Wnt protein is one of the extracellular ligands binding to the family of Frizzled receptors associated with several receptor-related proteins. Also, the Wnt pathways are regulated with activators or inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Especially, the secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) (also known as SDF5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) is a competitive inhibitor to act as antagonist of the Wnt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>During embryogenesis, where Wnt signaling is involved, the defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic> causes brachysyndactyly in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our previous research also showed that the dysfunction of SFRP2 protein yields a phenotype of preaxial synpolydactyly and syndactyly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, SFRP2 has reported to be hypermethylated in the prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and to suppress bone formation in multiple myeloma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, the Wnt is known to maintain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) niche under the both canonical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and noncanonical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and various Wnt antagonists such as SFRP2 are suggested to play a role in the regulation of HSCs. In the Wnt pathways of hematopoiesis, SFRP2 as secreted protein is suggested to inhibit the Wnt pathway and maintain the quiescent of HSCs in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. SFRP2 is also known to be expressed in osteoblasts in BM and related to the proliferation of HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the function of SFRP2 on immune system is still unclear, especially in the calcium signaling of B lymphocytes.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that SFRP2 modulates the calcium signal transduction associated with activation cascade in downstream of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice of wild-type (<italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) C57BL/6 and of <italic>Sfrp2-</italic>defective strains (<italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) were bred under the specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions as described in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

Because there was no difference in these proteins between <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, the defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic> was considered not to play a role in the downstream of PLC&#x003b3;2. Also, in the downstream of calcium signaling cascade related to BCR signaling pathway, no significant difference of phosphorylation in JNK and ATF-2 was found between <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated B lymphocytes in mice affected by the defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic>, and this defect did not yield the remarkable influence on the early differentiation of B cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, we further examined mature B cells in spleen about the influence of the defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic> in intracellular signal transduction in detail.</p><p>The calcium signaling plays a very critical role in the immune system including B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and so the calcium influx for splenic B cells with <italic>Sfrp2</italic> defect was selectively examined. We showed that the calcium signal transduction by BCR activation was slightly increased in <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> as well as <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells under calcium free condition (open arrows in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Moreover, no difference of ER abundance was observed between these B cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, we could conclude that no significant difference was observed in the intracellular calcium store in both <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>and <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells. However, when the calcium was added in the extracellular space (dotted arrows in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), intracellular calcium levels were rapidly increased in both <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells due to the influx of extracellular calcium by the BCR stimulation. This was considered to be attributed to the activation of calcium release-activated calcium channel in the plasma membrane triggered by emptying of ER calcium stores under calcium free condition and the first IgM stimulation (open arrows in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Subsequently, intracellular calcium levels gradually decreased and differed significantly between <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). By contrast, intracellular calcium levels were rapidly decreased to the same levels in both splenic B cells after EGTA addition (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Therefore, this phenomenon was observed as a result of the difference of the calcium influx from extracellular to intracellular space between <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells.</p><p>This calcium influx phenomenon is known to be associated with the activation of several proteins involved in the regulation of cell homeostasis. Specifically, protein tyrosine kinases such as Syk and Lyn are initially activated in response to BCR stimulation, which leads to the activation of Btk and CD19. PLC&#x003b3;2 is then activated by Btk, and cleaves phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) into diacylglycerol and inositol (1, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) by hydrolysis. Subsequently, IP<sub>3</sub> induced calcium release from intracellular ER calcium stores by binding to the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor. The catalytic hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> is suggested to require the phosphorylation of Tyr759 in PLC&#x003b3;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, the role of Tyr759 phosphorylation is considered to be different from that of Tyr1217 in PLC&#x003b3;2 according to the types of cells or stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results clearly showed that the defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic> does not affect the phosphorylation of Syk, Lyn, Btk, and CD19, but reduces the phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;2 at Tyr1217, whereas Tyr759 phosphorylation remained unaffected (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). This result may indicate that the <italic>Sfrp2</italic> participates in not pivotally regulating the catalytic hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> but modulating the calcium signal transduction.</p><p>It was unknown if the effect of these defective <italic>Sfrp2</italic> on PLC&#x003b3;2 is correlated with other abnormal mechanisms in the canonical and/or non-canonical pathways. First, since SFRP2 is not expressed in the hematopoietic cells, especially in splenic B cells compared to BM cells in <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), exogenous SFRP2 provided from other tissues may contribute to the calcium signaling in the splenic B cell. Moreover, since &#x003b2;-catenin is rarely detectable as protein levels in these splenic B cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), exogenous SFRP2 may act on the calcium signaling through non-canonical pathway. However, NFAT1, NFAT2, JNK, and ATF-2, which are considered as members of a cascade in downstream of non-canonical signaling pathway, were found not to play a significant role in the <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C and D). Taken together, the dysregulation of calcium signaling in the <italic>Sfrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> splenic B cells occurs under BCR stimulation and is likely to be correlated with unknown common underlying signal pathway(s) of both BCR and non-canonical signalings.</p><p>As previously reported, the expression of SFRP2 was down-regulated by methylation in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because calcium signaling was reduced by defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic>, down-regulation of SFRP2 is assumed to impair the calcium signal transduction in each tissue or cell. However the immune dysfunction was not observed in our SFRP2 deficient mice under the SPF condition, it was reported the association between the methylation of SFRP2 and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although further examination is needed, our results might give us the new insights to understand the functions of SFRP2 under the BCR and calcium signal pathway and the mechanisms of several human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The defect of <italic>Sfrp2</italic> in mice splenic B cells causes the impairment of calcium influx and the activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 in the BCR signaling pathway.
