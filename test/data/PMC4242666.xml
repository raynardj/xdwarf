Mutations at the hinge region of the N-terminal Venus flytrap domain (VFTD) produce either receptor inactivation (L173P, P221Q) or activation (L173F, P221L) related to hypercalcemic or hypocalcemic disorders. In this paper, we report that both L173P and P221Q markedly impair the functional positive cooperativity of the CaSR as reflected by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>&#x02013;induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations, inositol-1-phosphate (IP<sub>1</sub>) accumulation and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK<sub>1/2</sub>) activity. In contrast, L173F and P221L show enhanced responsiveness of these three functional readouts to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Further analysis of the dynamics of the VFTD mutants using computational simulation studies supports disruption in the correlated motions in the loss-of-function CaSR mutants, while these motions are enhanced in the gain-of-function mutants. Wild type (WT) CaSR was modulated by L-Phe in a heterotropic positive cooperative way, achieving an EC<sub>50</sub> similar to those of the two activating mutations. The response of the inactivating P221Q mutant to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was partially rescued by L-Phe, illustrating the capacity of the L-Phe binding site to enhance the positive homotropic cooperativity of CaSR. L-Phe had no effect on the other inactivating mutant. Moreover, our results carried out both <italic>in silico</italic> and in intact cells indicate that residue Leu<sup>173</sup>, which is close to residues that are part of the L-Phe-binding pocket, exhibited impaired heterotropic cooperativity in the presence of L-Phe. Thus, Pro<sup>221</sup> and Leu<sup>173</sup> are important for the positive homo- and heterotropic cooperative regulation elicited by agonist binding.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>) grants GM081749 and EB007268 to JJY; National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov/">http://www.nsf.gov/</ext-link>) grant MCB-0953061 to DH; and a Center for Diagnostic Technology - Georgia State University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cdt.gsu.edu/">http://cdt.gsu.edu/</ext-link>) fellowship to CZ.

The principal role of CaSR is to sense alterations of the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) and to maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion as well as renal Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption. Like other members of family C in the GPCR superfamily, the CaSR possesses a large extracellular domain (ECD) consisting of more than 600 amino acids <xref rid="pone.0113622-Mun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the principal physiological agonist for CaSR, is thought to bind to the ECD of the dimeric form of the receptor resulting in activation of phospholipase C (PLC), with an attendant accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) followed by a resultant increase in the cytosolic calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) concentration <xref rid="pone.0113622-Hofer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Fluctuations of the plasma levels of amino acids can regulate the rate of hormone synthesis and secretion as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism, among other processes <xref rid="pone.0113622-Conigrave1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. CaSR is present throughout the gastrointestinal tract <xref rid="pone.0113622-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113622-Conigrave2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. L-amino acids, especially aromatic amino acids, are known to enhance the sensitivity of CaSR to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, which could be one potential explanation for how dietary protein modulates [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> homeostasis in normal individuals as well as in patients with chronic renal failure <xref rid="pone.0113622-Conigrave1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113622-Conigrave3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Mutations of the CaSR can perturb intracellular signaling events (e.g., intracellular calcium responses) and disrupt regulation of PTH secretion from the parathyroid chief cell and Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption in the renal tubule. Mutations that inactivate CaSR (i.e., result in loss-of-function) cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) <xref rid="pone.0113622-Pidasheva1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113622-Thakker1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, activating mutations of the CaSR lead to autosomal dominant hypocalcemia with hypercalciuria (ADHH) <xref rid="pone.0113622-Hannan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These mutations, including the four studied here that involve the two &#x0201c;toggle&#x0201d; residues, Leu<sup>173</sup> and Pro<sup>221</sup>, where mutations of the same residue can either activate or inactivate the CaSR, serve as a rich source of structure-function information.</p><p>Interestingly, among thirty-four identified ECD missense mutations in patients with FHH, NSHPT and ADHH, 18 were located within 10 &#x000c5; of one or more of the five Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites predicted in our previous studies <xref rid="pone.0113622-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, particularly site 1, which is proposed to be the principal site for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding during receptor activation as well as for regulating both the homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity of CaSR <xref rid="pone.0113622-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0113622-Hannan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Our group has also reported a putative L-Phe binding site composed of residues S170, Y218, L51, S272 and T145, which are located adjacent to the predicted calcium binding pocket 1 at the hinge region of the CaSR ECD <xref rid="pone.0113622-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The location of the L-Phe binding site is pivotal in cooperatively regulating the activity of the CaSR <xref rid="pone.0113622-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Our previous computational studies showed that movements of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site 1 are dynamically correlated with those of the other predicted calcium-binding sites. Mutations in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site 1 could, therefore, affect both the homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity of the CaSR. These results led us to hypothesize that residues 173 and 221 are essential for the functional cooperativity orchestrated by calcium and L-Phe binding, and that related disease-associated mutations are the result of alteration or perturbation of the receptor's associated molecular connectivity.</p><p>In the present studies, we show that the loss-of-function mutations, L173P and P221Q, but not the gain-of-function mutations, L173F and P221L, alter the cooperativity of the CaSR though analyzing changes in functional readouts in response to alterations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, L173P and P221Q disrupt the strong correlated motions among the various calcium-binding sites as demonstrated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. L-Phe induced positive heterotropic cooperativity of the P221Q mutant, but had only a limited effect in potentiating the functional activity of L173P due to its restricted molecular dynamical features. These <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> results provide important insights into how Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Phe interact at their respective binding sites in the cleft of the VFTD, which are essential for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis that is required for normal physiological function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) (ATCC) were cultured under standard condition (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37&#x000b0;C) in High Glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma Chemicals) containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 100 &#x000b5;g/ml penicillin-streptomycin.

The coverslips were mounted in a bath chamber on the stage of a Leica DM6000 fluorescence microscope. The cells were alternately illuminated with 340 or 380 nm light, and the fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm was recorded in real time as the concentration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was increased in a stepwise manner in the presence or absence of 5 mM L-Phe. The ratio of emission fluorescence intensity from both excitation wavelengths was then monitored as a function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and utilized as a parameter reflecting changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> All experiments were performed at room temperature. In addition to the use of the cell population assay as a means of calculating EC<sub>50</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>

L-Phe did not left-shift the activation of the L173P mutant by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to the same extent that it did with the other loss-of-function mutant, P221Q, potentially because of the proximity of this residue to the binding site for L-Phe, which might interfere with L-Phe binding.

The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-triggered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillation pattern is believed to be modulated by the activity of phosphoinositide pathway <xref rid="pone.0113622-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> as well as a negative feedback loop involving the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on IP<sub>3</sub> production <xref rid="pone.0113622-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Downstream intracellular signaling responses, such as the production of IP<sub>1</sub> and the activity of ERK<sub>1/2</sub>, which will be discussed later, can be reflected in the oscillation patterns associated with the different disease-related mutations. Although most research has focused on intracellular calcium mobilization in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing the CaSR, CaSR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations have also been found in cells with endogenously expressed CaSR, for instance in parathyroid cells <xref rid="pone.0113622-Ridefelt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, bovine anterior pituitary cells <xref rid="pone.0113622-Shorte1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, opossum kidney (OK) cells <xref rid="pone.0113622-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and medullary thyroid carcinoma cells <xref rid="pone.0113622-Ridefelt2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Oscillations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> modulate not only the rate of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, but also gene expression and other processes <xref rid="pone.0113622-Dolmetsch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113622-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The pattern of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations is thus one of the most important signatures reflecting the state of CaSR activity. In the present study, we showed that the inactive mutants required higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to trigger intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations compared to the WT CaSR, while the active mutants needed lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to initiate oscillations. The oscillation frequency of the inactive mutants remained similar to that of the WT CaSR, but higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations frequencies were observed in HEK293 cells transfected with gain-of-function mutations. As [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is increased, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations cease and reach a plateau in CaSR-transfected cells as the desensitization process occurs and/or there is depletion of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> stores. Although the loss-of-function mutation L173P still oscillated at 30.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, considering the elevated and broad range of its sensitivity to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, it is possible that a plateau would be reached at even higher levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>Our studies of CaSR-mediated accumulation IP<sub>1</sub> (a metabolite of IP<sub>3</sub>) and activation of the ERK<sub>1/2</sub> pathways in HEK293 cells transfected with the various CaSR mutants conveyed two messages: Firstly, the mutations caused changes in the patterns of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations that at least partially involve activation of the G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub> pathway. The changes in the accumulation of IP<sub>1</sub> upon stimulation with various concentrations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> correlated well with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes. Secondly, high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-evoked increases in ERK<sub>1/2</sub> activities of WT-CaSR and its four mutants were in accordance with the accumulation of IP<sub>1</sub>. Stimulation of the ERK<sub>1/2</sub> activity in CaSR-transfected HEK293 cells has been reported to involve PKC-mediated as well as a PTX-sensitive, tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways <xref rid="pone.0113622-Kifor1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Although it is believed that the carboxyl terminus of the protein is involved in the activation of MAPK signaling by interacting with the scaffold protein, filamin A <xref rid="pone.0113622-Awata1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113622-Hjalm1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, other data showed that that alterations in the extracellular domain can also affect the ERK cascade, which is in agreement with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0113622-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Since all the mutations studied here were expressed at similar levels on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113622-g001">Figure 1b</xref>), these downstream signaling changes may at least partially be contributed by the disruption of cooperativity among different calcium binding sites introduced by different mutations. On the other hand, the gain-of-function mutations may increase the stability the receptor as suggested by other studies <xref rid="pone.0113622-Huang4" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, or they possibly induce more correlated motions among the calcium-binding sites as suggested by the dynamic cross-correlation map.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>L-Phe-induced heterotropic cooperativity rescues activity of the CaSR</title><p>In the current study, we showed that L-Phe could affect one or two of the three parameters depicting the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> triggered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillation patterns in all of the mutants as measured in individual cellular responses (e.g., [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillation starting points, ending points and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillation frequencies). The alterations in the oscillation patterns after the introduction of the allosteric activator could be the result of the activation of signaling downstream of G<sub>&#x003b1;12/13</sub> or a combined effect with the positive heterotropic cooperativity between the multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites induced by L-Phe. The interaction between CaSR and L-Phe has been reported to modulate the G<sub>&#x003b1;12/13</sub>-RhoA pathway <xref rid="pone.0113622-Breitwieser1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>; however, L-Phe could also potentially enhance [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-induced alterations in intracellular signaling pathways through G<sub>q/11</sub> pathway as reflected by the IP<sub>1</sub> accumulation assay.</p><p>The present study also confirms that the ERK signaling pathway in CaSR-transfected HEK293 cells can be modulated not only by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> but also by the positive allosteric modulator, L-Phe <xref rid="pone.0113622-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It should be noted that the ability of L-Phe to enhance the intracellular responses of the various signaling pathways varied between different mutations. L-Phe enhanced the maximum responses of the ERK signaling pathway to a greater extent than it altered the apparent affinities in the two gain-of-function mutants, although it barely showed any influence on the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-triggered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and IP<sub>1</sub> responses for these mutants, which may explain, in part, the dramatic changes in correlated motions from the computational simulation results using molecular dynamics. As a signaling messenger further downstream than either IP<sub>1</sub> or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, the phosphorylation of ERK<sub>1/2</sub> may not merely reflect activation of the G<sub>q/11</sub> pathway, but could be contributed to by other G-proteins (e.g., G<sub>i</sub>). In agreement with the in silico results, L-Phe exhibited less effect on the regulation of the ERK<sub>1/2</sub> pathway in mutant L173P. The predicted L-Phe-binding site has been reported to be located near the hinge region between lobe 1 and lobe 2 and to involve residues S169A/S170A/S171A <xref rid="pone.0113622-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Leu173 is located within 5 &#x000c5; of this region. The Leu to Pro change could potentially generate additional steric effects on the closure of lobe 1 and lobe 2 so that addition of exogenous L-Phe has relatively little impact on the CaSR's response to changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Thus, the hetero-cooperativity between the allosteric modulator and calcium binding sites could be disturbed, resulting in the lack of a left-shifted concentration-response curve in response to [L-Phe].</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Disease-associated mutations influence the molecular connectivity between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the CaSR as revealed by molecular dynamic simulations</title><p>Based on all of the <italic>in vitro</italic> results and the <italic>in silico</italic> simulations, we propose a model to illustrate the possible mechanism by which the disease-associated mutations affect the function of CaSR and how their activities can be modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Phe through the molecular connectivity that is encoded at the hinge region of the ECD of the protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113622-g010">Fig 10</xref>, there are four functional states of the CaSR. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, WT CaSR is at the basal state can be converted to the active state upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to site 1 at the hinge region. Subsequent binding of L-Phe at the adjacent hinge region further strengthens molecular connectivity and elevates the receptor to a &#x0201c;fully active&#x0201d; status in the presence of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> by a heterotropic positive cooperative mechanism. Mutations close to the hinge region such as those at Leu<sup>173</sup> and Pro<sup>221</sup> affect the overall dynamic correlated motions of the respective mutant receptors and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced homotropic cooperativity, which could further influence the conformation of the receptor. The inactivating mutation L173P impairs the molecular connectivity in the WT CaSR and cannot be rescued by L-Phe. On the other hand, the inactivating mutation P221Q weakens the connectivity but can be partially rescued by binding Phe with a resultant activity similar to the basal activity of the WT CaSR. In contrast, the gain-of-function mutants L173F and P221L may already have been converted to the active state with dynamic properties similar to that of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- loaded WT CaSR. They can be further activated upon binding extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to reach a state close to the &#x0201c;fully active&#x0201d; state (Phe + [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in the WT) that is insensitive to further activation by L-Phe achieving an apparent &#x0201c;ceiling&#x0201d; represented by the maximal achievable activity of the CaSR.</p><fig id="pone-0113622-g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113622.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying the effects of the mutations on the CaSR and the modulation of receptor activity by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Phe.</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Phe modulate the activity as well as the cooperativity of CaSR (the color changes of the receptor from white to red indicates an increase in functional activity). Elevating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, e.g., to 3.0 mM, is proposed to change the basal CaSR status into an active form in a positive homotropic cooperative manner and further trigger [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations. L-Phe binds to the hinge region between lobe 1 and lobe 2, modulating the receptor together with Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a positive heterotropic cooperative way. This could potentiate conversion of the receptor to a &#x0201c;fully active&#x0201d; form associated with a higher frequency of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations and a left-shifted EC<sub>50</sub>. Loss-of-function CaSR mutants (indicated by white color) could cause a disruption of the cooperativity among the various Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (dashed arrows). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> at 3.0 mM does not trigger [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in the mutant CaSRs. The impaired receptor function and the cross-talk between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites can be at least partially rescued for some mutants by L-Phe (e.g.P221Q). However, if the mutation interferes the interaction between CaSR and L-Phe, the function of the receptor may not be fully recovered (e.g.L173P). CaSR gain-of-function mutants (left) exhibit enhanced correlated motions (double line arrows) and their activity is not further potentiated by L-Phe, potentially due to a ceiling effect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0113622.g010"/></fig><p>The results from PCA may also provide an explanation as to why L-Phe interacts preferably with the P221Q mutant. L-Phe could not effectively shift the inactive population of conformational ensembles of L173P to an active ensemble of conformations as it did with the other inactivating mutant and WT. However, whether the <italic>in silico</italic> simulations provide a novel method to predict mutational effects on CaSR will ultimately require the kind of structural detail available for the mGluRs, whose structures have been solved. Here, the model structure does not take into consideration the possible interactions between the ECD and the extracellular loops and/or transmembrane domain as well as the intracellular domains. Thus, caution is merited in over-interpreting the <italic>in silico</italic> results. Nevertheless, the predicted structural motions may help to identify the mutations or ligands that produce increased or diminished coupling among specific structural elements within the CaSR ECD. While this type of analysis is limited at the moment to the environment of the orthosteric site, this strategy could facilitate drug design for modulating the functions of disease-related mutations affecting the CaSR, as well as other members of the family C GPCRs.</p><p>The distinctive combinatorial effects of L-Phe and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> on different mutant CaSRs also suggests that ligand selectivity at the orthosteric site and receptor activity at non-orthosteric sites could both contribute to the function of the receptor. This feature of the adjacent orthosteric binding sites and allosteric regulatory sites that cooperatively regulate the molecular connectivity may be shared by other members of the family C GPCRs <xref rid="pone.0113622-BraunerOsborne1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113622-Hammerland1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing receptor, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> regulates 14 of the other members of the family C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and receptors for pheromones, amino acids and sweet substances <xref rid="pone.0113622-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113622-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113622-Silve1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

For instance, the analyses of multiple point mutations in the taste receptors (T1R1/T1R3) suggested that the combination of the two distinct determinants selectivity at the ligand binding site and receptor activity at allosteric sites may mediate the ligand specificity of T1R1/T1R3 <xref rid="pone.0113622-Toda1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, through analysis of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations and the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>- and L-Phe triggered downstream signaling changes, functional positive cooperativity of CaSR was revealed to be disrupted in the identified FHH-associated CaSR mutations, L173P and P221Q, but not in the ADHH related mutations, L173F and P221L. The addition of L-Phe rescued the function of P221Q by inducing heterotropic positive cooperativity. The distinctive correlated motions of the gain-of-function mutations, on the one hand, and the loss-of-function mutations, on the other, and the potential utility revealed by the molecular dynamic simulation in providing insights into the mechanism for the disease-associated functional alterations in the receptor may also apply to other GPCR proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113622.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
