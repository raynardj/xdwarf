Many clinical cases showed that Chan su has severe side-effects on the CNS, causing shortness of breath, breathlessness, seizure, coma and cardiac arrhythmia. We used whole-cell recordings from brain slices to determine the effects of bufadienolides on excitability of a principal neuron in main olfactory bulb (MOB), mitral cells (MCs), and the cellular mechanism underlying the excitation. At higher concentrations, cinobufagin and resibufogenin induced irreversible over-excitation of MCs indicating a toxic effect. At lower concentrations, they concentration-dependently increased spontaneous firing rate, depolarized the membrane potential of MCs, and elicited inward currents. The excitatory effects were due to a direct action on MCs rather than an indirect phasic action. Bufadienolides and ouabain had similar effects on firing of MCs which suggested that bufadienolides activated neuron through a ouabain-like effect, most likely by inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. The direct action of bufadienolide on brain Na<sup>+</sup> channels was tested by recordings from stably Na<sub>v</sub>1.2-transfected cells. Bufadienolides failed to make significant changes of the main properties of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels in current amplitude, current-voltage (I-V) relationships, activation and inactivation. Our results suggest that inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may be involved in both the pharmacological and toxic effects of bufadienolide-evoked CNS excitation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by U.S. PHS grants (GM08016 and MD07597 to T.H., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usphs.gov/">www.usphs.gov/</ext-link>) and Foundation of Selected Item Support for Researcher Back from Overseas to Z.J.W.

It is traditionally used as a cardiotonic agent, CNS respiratory stimulant, analgesic, anesthetic and as remedies for ulcer boils, scrofula, sore throat, and cancer for hundreds of years in China and in most eastern countries in Asia. It is also the major component of such popular traditional Chinese medications as Lu-Shen-Wan <xref rid="pone.0113272-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, She-Xiang-Bao-Xin-Wan <xref rid="pone.0113272-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and Kyushin <xref rid="pone.0113272-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These medicines are used as remedies for tonsillitis, sore throat, furuncle, palpitations, and as a cardiotonic agent for stimulation of myocardial contraction <xref rid="pone.0113272-Danchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113272-Kau1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and as analgesic for pain relief <xref rid="pone.0113272-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The major active components in chan su are bufadienolides such as bufalin, cinobufagin and resibufogenin. Bufadienolides are a group of steroid hormones. They inhibit the adenosine triphosphatase sodium-potassium pump, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase <xref rid="pone.0113272-Puschett1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113272-Fedorova2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Like other cardiac glycosides such as digoxin, bufadienolides cause an increase in sodium excretion, produce vasoconstriction resulting in hypertension, and act as cardiac inotropes <xref rid="pone.0113272-Puschett1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The chemical structure of several toad-derived bufadienolides has similarities to digoxin/digitalis with similar cardiotoxic and lethal effects. The adverse drug effects of digoxin, which is used to treat various heart conditions, are concentration-dependent and the result of competition of digoxin with K<sup>+</sup> ions for the same binding site on the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump.</p><p>Recent studies showed that bufadienolides display many pharmacological actions such as anti-inflammation <xref rid="pone.0113272-deVasconcelos1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Forshammar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, enhancement of cardiac contractility <xref rid="pone.0113272-Wansapura1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, inhibition of tumors by inducing apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0113272-Kawazoe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Takai1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It is thought that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase participates in these cardiotonic and anti-tumor actions.</p><p>Chan su and Chan su-containing medicines such as Liu-Shen-Wan display pharmacological and toxic effects on the peripheral and central nervous system in clinical cases and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments <xref rid="pone.0113272-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Topical administration of Chan su results in strong anesthetic effects <xref rid="pone.0113272-Chinese1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Many clinical cases have reported that high dosages of either Liu-Shen-Wan or Chan su cause severe side-effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, over-excitation of the respiratory system and breathlessness, seizure, and coma <xref rid="pone.0113272-Kostakis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113272-Xie2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Takai1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A fatal case has been reported of a Chinese woman after ingestion of Chinese herbal tea that contained Chan su <xref rid="pone.0113272-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Evidence from the clinic and behavioral experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> have shown that Liu-Shen-Wan or Chan su are toxic for the heart and CNS <xref rid="pone.0113272-Chinese1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. An overdose of bufadienolides or Liu-Shen-Wan results not only in cardiac arrhythmia by modifying the functions of both cardiomyocytes and Purkinje fibers of the heart <xref rid="pone.0113272-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Xie2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Morishita1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but also evokes epileptic seizures <xref rid="pone.0113272-Brubacher1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, acute shortness of breath, muscle cramps, and finally death by paralysis by affecting the CNS <xref rid="pone.0113272-Chinese1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Morishita1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Dasgupta2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. While the effects of chan su and bufadienolides on the cardiac system have been widely studied, the pharmacological and toxic effects of bufadienolides on neurons in the CNS are unknown. Here, we hypothesize that Chan su and bufadienolides activate neurons in the CNS, and that neuronal activation by and excitotoxic effects of bufadienolides are mediated by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump. The involvement of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in activation of neurons could, therefore, be the basis for the neuro-pharmacological and toxic effects of Chan su.</p><p>Cinobufagin and resibufogenin are the major active bufadienolides isolated from Chan su (chemical structures are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113272-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Resibufogenin was recently shown to activate voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels but to reduce the firing rate of evoked repetitive firing in cultured rat hippocampal neurons <xref rid="pone.0113272-Hao1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A reduction of evoked firing rate appears to contrast sharply with the reported toxic effects of Chan su since symptoms of Chan su-mediated toxic effects in the clinic suggest an excitatory action on neurons. MCs are principal neurons and play a crucial role in processing sensory information in the mouse MOB. They receive direct synaptic inputs from the axons of olfactory receptor neurons, send excitatory projections to olfactory cortical areas, and receive strong feedback inhibition primarily through reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with local interneurons <xref rid="pone.0113272-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Ennis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. MCs in the MOB display their neuronal activity as spontaneous action potential firing with a frequency of 1&#x02013;6 Hz. The excitability of MCs can be modulated by intrinsic membrane receptors as well as synaptic inputs <xref rid="pone.0113272-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113272-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, MCs are an advantageous cell type to explore their possible interaction with bufadienolides. Here, we used electrophysiological recordings from MCs in acute slice preparations of the mouse MOB and from transfected cells expressing Na<sup>+</sup> channels to determine the effects of bufadienolides on neuron activity, and the possible mechanisms underlying the pharmacological and toxic effects of bufadienolides or Chan su.</p><fig id="pone-0113272-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113272.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Chemical structures of cinobufagin and resibufogenin.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0113272.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals and Slice Preparation</title><p>The experiments were approved by the Howard University Animal Care and Use Committee.

This finding is consistent with reports showing that the cardiotonic steroids ouabain, digoxin, and bufadienolides all show an inverted U-shaped dose&#x02013;response curve with inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity at higher concentrations, while increasing Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity at low concentrations <xref rid="pone.0113272-Bagrov2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Oselkin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Cardiotonic steroids like ouabain are synthesized endogenously and are active at nanomolar concentrations <xref rid="pone.0113272-Bagrov2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. At lower, physiological concentrations that occur <italic>in vivo</italic>, cardiotonic steroids could increase Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity <xref rid="pone.0113272-Bagrov2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Bufadienolides may similarly induce Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity at lower concentrations.</p><p>Chan su is often a key component found in formulations of traditional Chinese medicine such as Liu-Shen-Wan, Kyusin. Both Chinese medicines are popular traditional Chinese medicines widely used for hundreds of years as remedies for tonsillitis, sore throat, furuncle, and palpitations. The clinical use of these medicines suggests that they have an anti-inflammatory effect. The steroid ouabain is also considered an immunomodulatory molecule capable of modulating many aspects of the immune system that may participate in anti-inflammatory effects <xref rid="pone.0113272-RodriguesMascarenhas1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The reported serum concentrations of bufadienolides were between 0.51 nM (0.4 ng/mL) and 1.1 nM (0.88 ng/mL) in healthy volunteers after ingesting kyushin tablets or Lu-Shen-Wen pills <xref rid="pone.0113272-Fushimi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Panesar1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Recent studies showed that activation or modulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase are involved in anti-inflammation <xref rid="pone.0113272-deVasconcelos1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-Forshammar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113272-CohenLuria1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and in protecting hippocampal slice cultures from experimental ischemia <xref rid="pone.0113272-Oselkin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, we suggest that the activation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is a possible pharmacological mechanism, at least in part, of the anti-inflammatory action of Lu-Shen-Wen. It has been recently reported that prior ouabain administration had an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing a mouse paw edema <xref rid="pone.0113272-deVasconcelos1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In response to inflammatory stimuli, ultralow concentrations (10<sup>-6</sup> &#x000b5;M) of ouabain restored Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase <xref rid="pone.0113272-Forshammar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Participation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in immune responses has been reported <xref rid="pone.0113272-LacroixLamand1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. All of these studies support the idea that nanomolar concentrations of bufadienolides have anti-inflammatory effects that contribute to the efficacy of Lu-Shen-Wen in treating tonsillitis and sore throat. Therefore, bufadienolides may exhibit distinct pharmacological effects at different levels of concentration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present results suggest that bufadienolides exhibited excitatory and toxic effects on neurons in the CNS. The effects of resibufogenin and cinobufagin on neuronal activity and ionic currents were mimicked by ouabain, strongly suggesting that bufadienolides activated neuron by having an ouabain-like effect. The excitatory and toxic effects on neurons in the CNS were, most likely, mediated by inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase rather than by activation of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> channels.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. William A.
