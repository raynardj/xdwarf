Recently, availability of selective pharmacological tools has enabled great advances in our knowledge of the role of the cannabinoid receptors in pathophysiology. In particular, cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) has emerged as an attractive target for management of chronic pain, as demonstrated in several studies with inflammatory and neuropathic preclinical pain models.

Many contributing factors can result in abnormal pain etiology, including both peripheral and central pain processing and structural abnormalities of the pancreatic gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The higher incidence in men reported nationally is attributed not only to alcohol and tobacco abuse as risk factors, but a genetic prevalence in men to have the CLDN2 risk factor DNA variant with alcohol associated chronic pancreatitis (47%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pain management in CP is challenging and often leads to time-consuming and unsatisfactory approaches to treatment with an unpredictable outcome. Despite the availability of analgesics approved for chronic or neuropathic pain, current analgesics only provide partial pain relief and/or produce significant side effects. Recently, availability of selective pharmacological tools has enabled great advance of our knowledge of the role of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) in pathophysiology. The cannabinoid receptors are a class of cell membrane receptors under the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. There are currently two known subtypes, termed CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptors are expressed mainly in the brain (central nervous system or "CNS"), but also in the lungs, liver and kidneys. CB2 receptors are largely restricted to immune and hematopoetic cells, although functionally relevant expression has been found in specific regions of the brain and in myocardium, gut, endothelial, vascular smooth muscle and Kupffer cells, exocrine and endocrine pancreas, bone, reproductive organs/cells, and in various tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Evidence suggests that there are novel cannabinoid receptors, that is, non-CB1 and non-CB2, which are expressed in endothelial cells and in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Initially the interest in cannabinoid receptors as potential targets for chronic pain was limited to cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), with the aim of identifying an agonist suitable for drug development. Unfortunately analgesia induced by CB1 agonists is associated with undesirable central nervous system side effects which have hampered their progress for therapeutic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2) has emerged as an interesting target alternative to CB1. Its expression is upregulated in response to tissue or nerve injury, and in preclinical pain models the activation of this receptor induces significant analgesia without overt side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The most likely cellular targets and executors of the CB2 receptor-mediated effects of endocannabinoids or synthetic agonists are proposed to be the immune and immune-derived cells (e.g. leukocytes, various populations of T and B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, microglia in the brain, Kupffer cells in the liver, etc.). However, the number of other potential cellular targets is expanding, now including epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts of various origins, cardiomyocytes, and certain neuronal elements of the peripheral or central nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the brain, CB2 receptors are predominately expressed by microglial cells, where their role remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] but is suggestive of an anti-inflammatory role. In particular, CB2 for chronic pain treatment has been successfully demonstrated by several studies with inflammatory and neuropathic preclinical pain models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. While the CB2 receptors are involved in mediating analgesic effects in the peripheral nervous system, these receptors are not expressed by nociceptive sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At present CB2 receptors are believed to exist on an undetermined, non-neuronal cell in the vicinity of peripheral nerve terminals. Possible candidates in the pancreas include mast cells and innate immune stellate cells which are known to facilitate the inflammatory response. Cannabinoid mediated inhibition of these responses may be caused by a decrease in the receptor perception of noxious stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recent studies showed that CB1 and CB2 are also expressed on pancreatic acinar cells, and the relatively nonselective CB1/CB2 agonist HU210 ameliorates acute experimental pancreatitis by systemic administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. During acute pancreatitis, an upregulation especially of CB2 on apoptotic cells has been shown, and activation of cannabinoid receptor 2 attenuated the acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Little is known about the effects of CB2 that impact inflammation and pain in chronic pancreatitis.</p><p>In the present study, a novel CB2 receptor agonist LY3038404 HCl was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in the AHF chronic pancreatitis rat model. The major finding of the present study is that the potent CB2 receptor agonist LY3038404 HCl possesses tissue protection and analgesic properties. No side effects on higher brain function were observed. Thus, activation of CB2 receptors is suggested as a potential therapeutic target for visceral inflammation and pain management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>AHF diet induced chronic pancreatitis histopathology</title><p>The AHF pancreatitis rats gain less body weight per week compared to control rats fed standard rodent chow.

Pancreatic paraffin tissue sections were exposed to antigen-retrieval in boiling Tris-EDTA Buffer (10&#x000a0;mM Tris Base, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA Solution, 0.05% Tween 20, pH&#x000a0;9.0), followed by antibody incubation and detection using the ABC-Vectastain system with the Vector DAB substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, INC, Burlingame, CA). Sections were counterstained with Eosin. Primary antibody was rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Quantification was performed by counting Ki67 positive cells in an entire tissue section using a 20&#x000d7; objective. The image of the whole tissue section was captured with a digital camera (Canon, PowerShot, ELPH 300HS). The total area (mm<sup>2</sup>) of the entire tissue sections was measured with the Image J program (v1.46r; NIH), and the number of Ki67 positive cells per mm<sup>2</sup> area was determined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Pancreas Histological Severity Scoring (HSS)</title><p>Hematoxylin-eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining was performed on 5 &#x003bc;m paraffin embedded pancreatic sections. Severity of pancreatic tissue damage was graded by a semi-quantitative scoring system (HSS). Within pancreatic sections, areas of abnormal pancreatic tissue architecture were graded: global glandular degeneration (acini and islets), vacuolization (fat deposition), acinar and islet cell atrophy including focal atrophy, area atrophy; and fibrosis: periductal, interlobular and intralobular fibrosis. These parameters were graded as follows: 0, absent; 1, minimal (&#x0003c;10%); 2, moderate (30 - 50%); and 3, major (&#x0003e;50 - 70%) percentage of the entire pancreatic section examined, as described by others previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

With this type of histological staining, the fibrous collagen deposition was stained red. Bright-field, polarized, TIFF images from the pancreas head and tail were acquired from consecutive non-overlapping fields using a Nikon E1000 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200F digital camera and ACT-1 Program (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Animals were placed on a raised wire mesh table (76 &#x000d7;38 cm), under a clear plastic ventilated rat restrainer (18 &#x000d7;13 &#x000d7;15 cm) for a 30 min acclimatization period. The mechanical withdrawal threshold testing was done on the plantar surface of both hindpaws using a set 8 of von Frey monofilaments. The von Frey filaments were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface with sufficient force to bend the monofilament slightly and held for about 5 seconds. A positive response was defined as an abrupt withdrawal (flick response) of the foot during stimulation or immediately after the removal of stimulus. Whenever there was a negative or positive response, the next stronger or weaker filament was applied, respectively. The pattern of positive and negative responses was converted into a 50% threshold value (in grams) using a curve-fitting algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The 50% decreased paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) indicated secondary mechanical allodynia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Assessment of abdominal secondary heat hyperalgesia</title><p>Nocifensive responses to heat stimuli were tested by measuring the abdomen withdrawal latency with the modified Hargreaves test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The radiant heat source was shone onto the abdominal skin of the reclining rats. Rats&#x02019; abdominal skin was shaved one day before the test each week. Rats were placed in separate clear plastic ventilated restrainers (18 &#x000d7;13 &#x000d7;15 cm) on a glass-top table (approximately 2 mm thick glass) and allowed to acclimate to their new environment for 30 min before testing. A high-intensity light beam was applied to the shaved abdominal skin surface through the glass and the latency of reflexive withdrawal responses timed (seconds). The cutoff time for abdominal withdrawal latency was set at 40 s to avoid any damage to the skin. A withdrawal event to radiant heat was defined as a weight shifting (either abdominal musculature contraction or lifting of the abdomen through postural adjustment) accompanied by head turning toward the stimuli and licking of the abdominal area. The abdomen withdrawal latency was tested in 3 trials for averages. The 5-min intervals between trials and a cooling fan under the table assured the temperature of the glass surface returned to room temperature (22 - 24&#x000b0;C) prior to the next trial. Shortened abdomen withdrawal latency values indicated a secondary heat hyperalgesia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Modified 44&#x000b0;C hotplate test</title><p>Because C-fiber nociceptors are active under sustained, low-intensity heat stimulation, the modified hotplate test assessed responses to moderately noxious stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In this study, two temperature controlled hotplates were topped with vented Plexiglas enclosures (26 cm &#x000d7; 26 cm &#x000d7; 28 cm) (Columbus Instruments, OH). One hotplate temperature was set at 38&#x000b0;C for pre-warming to normalize all animal paw temperatures, and the other one was set at 44&#x000b0;C. After a 30 min acclimation to the environment, rats were placed on the 38&#x000b0;C warm-up plate for 10 min. Then the rats were placed on the 44&#x000b0;C test plate for a 10 min test period. The latency to the first hindlimmb withdrawal response, the duration, and the frequency of hindlimb withdrawal events during heat stimulation were recorded. Event duration with hindpaws withdrawn from the plate began when the limb was lifted and finished when the limb made contact with the plate again. The events were plotted against time at 1 min intervals and a leftward shift of the event/time curve was an index of heat hyperalgesia. Erect leaning posture with forelegs against the wall of the enclosure (rearing event) was recorded. Rearing events were considered a noxious-evoked escape response during the hotplate test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Exploratory activity testing</title><p>Open field exploratory activity of the animals was monitored using the automated Flexfield Animal Activity System (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) with Photobeam Activity System software (PAS) coupled to a HP computer (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA).

Obstruction of these photobeams constitutes movements in the x and y planes. Another set of 16 beams is located 12&#x000a0;cm above the chamber floor to record movements in the z-plane (rearing events and duration). Data were collected for 45&#x000a0;minutes in nine 5-minute intervals.</p><p>The experiment was carried out in an isolated, temperature controlled (21 - 22&#x000b0;C) room, with consistent background white noise. When the tests started, the observer exits the room leaving the subjects undisturbed. Animals were tested at the same time of the day (from 9 am to 3 pm). To avoid acclimation of animals to the environment, repeat testing of the same animal occurred at least 24 h after the last test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Six main parameters were measured in the nine 5 min intervals: rearing events and rearing duration; total activities, i.e., number of photobeams broken (included the number of different zone entries and stationary fine movement, e.g., grooming) and distance traveled; active time and resting time. Resting time is defined as a period when the animal remained in place for 1 second or longer. This test is based on the natural exploratory or investigatory behaviors of rodents in a novel &#x0201c;open field&#x0201d; environment. All of the six parameters are important for evaluation of spontaneous pain and for comparison of the effects of drug treatment.
